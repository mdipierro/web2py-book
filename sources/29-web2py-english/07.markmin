## Forms and validators

There are four distinct ways to build forms in web2py:
- ``FORM`` provides a low-level implementation in terms of HTML helpers. A ``FORM`` object can be serialized into HTML and is aware of the fields it contains. A ``FORM`` object knows how to validate submitted form values.
- ``SQLFORM`` provides a high-level API for building create, update and delete forms from an existing database table.
- ``SQLFORM.factory`` is an abstraction layer on top of ``SQLFORM`` in order to take advantage of the form generation features even if there is no database present. It generates a form very similar to ``SQLFORM`` from the description of a table but without the need to create the database table.
- ``CRUD`` methods. These are functionally equivalent to SQLFORM and are based on SQLFORM, but provide a more compact notation; ``CRUD`` is now deprecated in favor of ``SQLFORM.grid()`` and ``SQLFORM.smartgrid()``.


All these forms are self-aware and, if the input does not pass validation, they can modify themselves and add error messages. The forms can be queried for the validated variables and for error messages that have been generated by validation.

Arbitrary HTML code can be inserted into or extracted from the form using helpers.

``FORM`` and ``SQLFORM`` are helpers and they can be manipulated in a similar way as the ``DIV``. For example you can set a form style:

``
form = SQLFORM(..)
form['_style']='border:1px solid black'
``:code

### ``FORM``
``form``:inxx ``accepts``:inxx

Consider as an example a **test** application with the following "default.py" controller:
``
def display_form():
    form = FORM('Your name:', INPUT(_name='name'), INPUT(_type='submit'))
    return dict(form=form) 
``:code

and the associated "default/display_form.html" view:
``
{{extend 'layout.html'}}
<h2>Input form</h2>
<form enctype="multipart/form-data"
      action="{{=URL()}}" method="post">
Your name:
<input name="name" />
<input type="submit" />
</form>
<h2>Submitted variables</h2>
{{=BEAUTIFY(request.vars)}}
``:code

This is a regular HTML form that asks for the user's name. When you fill the form and click the submit button, the form self-submits, and the variable ``request.vars.name`` along with its provided value is displayed at the bottom.

You can generate the same form using helpers. This can be done in the view or in the action. Since web2py processed the form in the action, it is better to define the form in the action itself.

Here is the new controller:
``
def display_form():
   form=FORM('Your name:', INPUT(_name='name'), INPUT(_type='submit'))
   return dict(form=form)
``:code

and the associated "default/display_form.html" view:
``
{{extend 'layout.html'}}
<h2>Input form</h2>
{{=form}}
<h2>Submitted variables</h2>
{{=BEAUTIFY(request.vars)}}
``:code

The code so far is equivalent to the previous code, but the form is generated by the statement ``{{=form}}`` which serializes the ``FORM`` object.

Now we add one level of complexity by adding form validation and processing.

Change the controller as follows:
``
def display_form():
    form=FORM('Your name:',
              INPUT(_name='name', requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
              INPUT(_type='submit'))
    if form.accepts(request, session):
        response.flash = 'form accepted'
    elif form.errors:
        response.flash = 'form has errors'
    else:
        response.flash = 'please fill the form'
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

and the associated "default/display_form.html" view:
``
{{extend 'layout.html'}}
<h2>Input form</h2>
{{=form}}
<h2>Submitted variables</h2>
{{=BEAUTIFY(request.vars)}}
<h2>Accepted variables</h2>
{{=BEAUTIFY(form.vars)}}
<h2>Errors in form</h2>
{{=BEAUTIFY(form.errors)}}
``:code

Notice that:
- In the action, we added the ``requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()`` validator for the input field "name".
- In the action, we added a call to ``form.accepts(..)``
- In the view, we are printing ``form.vars`` and ``form.errors`` as well as the form and ``request.vars``.

All the work is done by the ``accepts`` method of the ``form`` object. It filters the ``request.vars`` according to the declared requirements (expressed by validators). ``accepts`` stores those variables that pass validation into ``form.vars``. If a field value does not meet a requirement, the failing validator returns an error and the error is stored in ``form.errors``. Both ``form.vars`` and ``form.errors`` are ``gluon.storage.Storage`` objects similar to ``request.vars``. The former contains the values that passed validation, for example:
``
form.vars.name = "Max"
``:code

The latter contains the errors, for example:
``
form.errors.name = "Cannot be empty!"
``:code

The full signature of the ``accepts`` method is the following:
``onvalidation``:inxx
``
form.accepts(vars, session=None, formname='default',
             keepvalues=False, onvalidation=None,
             dbio=True, hideerror=False):
``:code

The meaning of the optional parameters is explained in the next sub-sections.

The first argument can be ``request.vars`` or ``request.get_vars`` or ``request.post_vars`` or simply ``request``. The latter is equivalent to accepting as input the ``request.post_vars``.

The ``accepts``  function returns ``True`` if the form is accepted and ``False`` otherwise. A form is not accepted if it has errors or when it has not been submitted (for example, the first time it is shown).

Here is how this page looks the first time it is displayed:

[[image @///image/en5800.png center 300px]]

Here is how it looks upon invalid submission:

[[image @///image/en5900.png center 300px]]

Here is how it looks upon a valid submission:

[[image @///image/en6000.png center 300px]]

#### The ``process`` and ``validate`` methods

A shortcut for
``
form.accepts(request.post_vars, session, ...)
``:code
is
``
form.process(...).accepted
``:code
the latter does not need the ``request`` and ``session`` arguments (although you can specify them optionally). it also differs from ``accepts`` because it returns the form itself. Internally ``process`` calls accepts and passes its arguments to it. The value returned by accepts is stored in ``form.accepted``.

The process function takes some extra argument that ``accepts`` does not take:
- ``message_onsuccess``
- ``onsuccess``: if equal to 'flash' (default) and the form is accepted it will flash the above ``message_onsuccess``
- ``message_onfailure``
- ``onfailure``: if equal to 'flash' (default) and the form fails validation, it will flash the above ``message_onfailure``
- ``next`` indicates where to redirect the user after the form is accepted.
``onsuccess`` and ``onfailure`` can be functions like ``lambda form: do_something(form)``.

``
form.validate(...)
``:code

is a shortcut for

``
form.process(..., dbio=False).accepted
``:code

#### Conditional fields

There are times when you only want a field to show up if a condition is met. For example, consider 
the following model:

``
db.define_table('purchase', Field('have_coupon', 'boolean'), Field('coupon_code'))
``

You want to display the field ``coupon_code`` if and only if the ``have_coupon`` field is checked.
This can be done in JavaScript. web2py can help you by generating that JavaScript for you. You just need to declare that the field is conditional to an expression using the field ``show_if`` attribute:

``
def index():
    db.purchase.coupon_code.show_if = (db.purchase.have_coupon==True)
    form = SQLFORM(db.purchase).process()
    return dict(form = form)
``

The value of ``show_if`` is a query and uses the same DAL syntax that you use for database queries. The difference is that this query is not sent to the database but it is converted to JavaScript and sent to the browser where it is executed when the user edits the form.

#### Hidden fields

When the above form object is serialized by ``{{=form}}``, and because of the previous call to the ``accepts`` method, it now looks like this:
``
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="" method="post">
your name:
<input name="name" />
<input type="submit" />
<input value="783531473471" type="hidden" name="_formkey" />
<input value="default" type="hidden" name="_formname" />
</form>
``:code

Notice the presence of two hidden fields: "_formkey" and "_formname". Their presence is triggered by the call to ``accepts`` and they play two different and important roles:
- The hidden field called "_formkey" is a one-time token that web2py uses to prevent double submission of forms. The value of this key is generated when the form is serialized and stored in the ``session``. When the form is submitted this value must match, or else ``accepts`` returns ``False`` without errors as if the form was not submitted at all. This is because web2py cannot determine whether the form was submitted correctly.
- The hidden field called "_formname" is generated by web2py as a name for the form, but the name can be overridden. This field is necessary to allow pages that contain and process multiple forms. web2py distinguishes the different submitted forms by their names.
- Optional hidden fields specified as ``FORM(..., hidden=dict(...))``.

The role of these hidden fields and their usage in custom forms and pages with multiple forms is discussed in more detail later in the chapter.

If the form above is submitted with an empty "name" field, the form does not pass validation. When the form is serialized again it appears as:
``
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="" method="post">
your name:
<input value="" name="name" />
<div class="error">cannot be empty!</div>
<input type="submit" />
<input value="783531473471" type="hidden" name="_formkey" />
<input value="default" type="hidden" name="_formname" />
</form>
``:code

Notice the presence of a DIV of class "error" in the serialized form. web2py inserts this error message in the form to notify the visitor about the field that did not pass validation. The ``accepts`` method, upon submission, determines that the form is submitted, checks whether the field "name" is empty and whether it is required, and eventually inserts the error message from the validator into the form.

The base "layout.html" view is expected to handle DIVs of class "error". The default layout uses jQuery effects to make errors appear and slide down with a red background. See [[Chapter 11 ../11#web2py_ajax-html]] for more details.

#### ``keepvalues``

``keepvalues``:inxx

The optional argument ``keepvalues`` tells web2py what to do when a form is accepted and there is no redirection, so the same form is displayed again. By default the form is cleared. If ``keepvalues`` is set to ``True``, the form is pre-populated with the previously inserted values. This is useful when you have a form that is supposed to be used repeatedly to insert multiple similar records.

#### ``dbio``
``dbio``:inxx
If the ``dbio`` argument is set to ``False``, web2py will not perform any DB insert/update after accepting form.

#### ``hideerror``
``hideerror``:inxx
If ``hideerror`` is set to ``True`` and the form contains errors, these will not be displayed when the form is rendered (it will be up to you to display them from ``form.errors`` somehow).

#### ``onvalidation``

The ``onvalidation`` argument can be ``None`` or can be a function that takes the form and returns nothing. Such a function would be called and passed the form, immediately after validation (if validation passes) and before anything else happens. This function has multiple purposes: for example, to perform additional checks on the form and eventually add errors to the form, or to compute the values of some fields based on the values of other fields, or to trigger some action (like sending an email) before a record is created/updated.

Here is an example:
``
db.define_table('numbers',
    Field('a', 'integer'),
    Field('b', 'integer'),
    Field('c', 'integer', readable=False, writable=False))

def my_form_processing(form):
    c = form.vars.a * form.vars.b
    if c < 0:
       form.errors.b = 'a*b cannot be negative'
    else:
       form.vars.c = c

def insert_numbers():
   form = SQLFORM(db.numbers)
   if form.process(onvalidation=my_form_processing).accepted:
       session.flash = 'record inserted'
       redirect(URL())
   return dict(form=form)
``:code

#### Detect record change

When filling a form to edit a record there is a small probability that another user may concurrently be editing the same record. So when we save the record we want to check for possible conflicts. This can be done:

``
db.define_table('dog', Field('name'))

def edit_dog():
    dog = db.dog(request.args(0)) or redirect(URL('error'))
    form=SQLFORM(db.dog, dog)
    form.process(detect_record_change=True)
    if form.record_changed:
        # do something
    elif form.accepted:
        # do something else
    else:
        # do nothing
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

``record_changed`` works only with a SQLFORM and not with a FORM.

#### Forms and redirection

The most common way to use forms is via self-submission, so that the submitted field variables are processed by the same action that generated the form. Once the form is accepted, it is unusual to display the current page again (something we are doing here only to keep things simple). It is more common to redirect the visitor to a "next" page.

Here is the new example controller:
``
def display_form():
    form = FORM('Your name:',
              INPUT(_name='name', requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
              INPUT(_type='submit'))
    if form.process().accepted:
        session.flash = 'form accepted'
        redirect(URL('next'))
    elif form.errors:
        response.flash = 'form has errors'
    else:
        response.flash = 'please fill the form'
    return dict(form=form)

def next():
    return dict()
``:code

In order to set a flash on the next page instead of the current page you must use ``session.flash`` instead of ``response.flash``. web2py moves the former into the latter after redirection. Note that using ``session.flash`` requires that you do not ``session.forget()``.

#### Multiple forms per page
``formname``:inxx

The content of this section applies to both ``FORM`` and ``SQLFORM`` objects.
It is possible to have multiple forms per page, but you must allow web2py to distinguish them. If these are derived by ``SQLFORM`` from different tables, then web2py gives them different names automatically; otherwise you need to explicitly give them different form names. Here is an example:
``
def two_forms():
    form1 = FORM(INPUT(_name='name', requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
                 INPUT(_type='submit'), _name='form_one')
    form2 = FORM(INPUT(_name='name', requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
                 INPUT(_type='submit'), _name='form_two')
    if form1.process(formname='form_one').accepted:
        response.flash = 'form one accepted'
    if form2.process(formname='form_two').accepted:
        response.flash = 'form two accepted'
    return dict(form1=form1, form2=form2)
``:code

and here is the output it produces:

[[image @///image/en6100.png center 300px]]

When the visitor submits an empty form1, only form1 displays an error; if the visitor submits an empty form2, only form2 displays an error message.

#### Sharing forms

The content of this section applies to both ``FORM`` and ``SQLFORM`` objects. What we discuss here is possible but not recommended, since it is always good practice to have forms that self-submit. Sometimes, though, you don't have a choice, because the action that sends the form and the action that receives it belong to different applications.

It is possible to generate a form that submits to a different action. This is done by specifying the URL of the processing action in the attributes of the ``FORM`` or ``SQLFORM`` object. For example:
``
form = FORM(INPUT(_name='name', requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
        INPUT(_type='submit'), _action=URL('page_two'))

def page_one():
    return dict(form=form)

def page_two():
    if form.process(session=None, formname=None).accepted:
         response.flash = 'form accepted'
    else:
         response.flash = 'there was an error in the form'
    return dict()
``:code

Notice that since both "page_one" and "page_two" use the same ``form``, we have defined it only once by placing it outside of all the actions, in order not to repeat ourselves. The common portion of code at the beginning of a controller gets executed every time before giving control to the called action.

Since "page_one" does not call ``process`` (nor ``accepts``), the form has no name and no key, so you must pass  ``session=None`` and set ``formname=None`` in ``process``, or the form will not validate when "page_two" receives it.

#### Adding buttons to FORMs

Usually a form provides a single submit button. It is common to want to add a "back" button that instead of submitting the form, directs the visitor to a different page.

``add_button``:inxx

This can be done with the ``add_button`` method:

``
form.add_button('Back', URL('other_page'))
``:code

You can add more than one button to form. The arguments of ``add_button`` are the value of the button (its text) and the url where to redirect to.
(See also the buttons argument for SQLFORM, which provides a more powerful approach)

#### More about manipulation of FORMs
As discussed in the Views chapter, a FORM is an HTML helper. Helpers can be manipulated as Python lists and as dictionaries, which enables run-time creation and modification.

### ``SQLFORM``

We now move to the next level by providing the application with a model file:
``
db = DAL('sqlite://storage.sqlite')
db.define_table('person', Field('name', requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
``:code

Modify the controller as follows:
``
def display_form():
   form = SQLFORM(db.person)
   if form.process().accepted:
       response.flash = 'form accepted'
   elif form.errors:
       response.flash = 'form has errors'
   else:
       response.flash = 'please fill out the form'
   return dict(form=form)
``:code

The view does not need to be changed.

In the new controller, you do not need to build a ``FORM``, since the ``SQLFORM`` constructor built one from the table ``db.person`` defined in the model. This new form, when serialized, appears as:
``
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="" method="post">
  <table>
    <tr id="person_name__row">
       <td><label id="person_name__label"
                  for="person_name">Your name: </label></td>
       <td><input type="text" class="string"
                  name="name" value="" id="person_name" /></td>
       <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr id="submit_record__row">
       <td></td>
       <td><input value="Submit" type="submit" /></td>
       <td></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <input value="9038845529" type="hidden" name="_formkey" />
  <input value="person" type="hidden" name="_formname" />
</form>
``:code

The automatically generated form is more complex than the previous low-level form. First of all, it contains a table of rows, and each row has three columns. The first column contains the field labels (as determined from the ``db.person``), the second column contains the input fields (and eventually error messages), and the third column is optional and therefore empty (it can be populated with the fields in the ``SQLFORM`` constructor).

All tags in the form have names derived from the table and field name. This allows easy customization of the form using CSS and JavaScript. This capability is discussed in more detail in [[Chapter 11 ../11#Conditional-fields-in-forms]].

More important is that now the ``accepts`` method does a lot more work for you. As in the previous case, it performs validation of the input, but additionally, if the input passes validation, it also performs a database insert of the new record and stores in ``form.vars.id`` the unique "id" of the new record.

A ``SQLFORM`` object also deals automatically with "upload" fields by saving uploaded files in the "uploads" folder (after having them renamed safely to avoid conflicts and prevent directory traversal attacks) and stores their names (their new names) into the appropriate field in the database. After the form has been processed, the new filename is available in ``form.vars.fieldname`` (i.e., it replaces the ``cgi.FieldStorage`` object in ``request.vars.fieldname``), so you can easily reference the new name right after upload.

------
Warning:
the default field length is 512 chars. If one's filesystem does not support filenames this long, it can generate names that will cause an error when an attempt is made to create them. This can be solved by setting the ``Field(..., length=...)`` to approriate value. Also notice this may truncate the encoding of the original filename and it may be impossible to recover it upon downloading of the uploaded file.
------

A ``SQLFORM`` displays "boolean" values with checkboxes, "text" values with textareas, values required to be in a definite set or a database with drop-downs, and "upload" fields with links that allow users to download the uploaded files. It hides "blob" fields, since they are supposed to be handled differently, see [[More on uploads ../06#More-on-uploads]] section in Chapter 6 for an example.

For example, consider the following model:
``
db.define_table('person',
    Field('name', requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
    Field('married', 'boolean'),
    Field('gender', requires=IS_IN_SET(['Male', 'Female', 'Other'])),
    Field('profile', 'text'),
    Field('image', 'upload'))
``:code

In this case, ``SQLFORM(db.person)`` generates the form shown below:

[[image @///image/en6200.png center 300px]]

The ``SQLFORM`` constructor allows various customizations, such as displaying only a subset of the fields, changing the labels, adding values to the optional third column, or creating UPDATE and DELETE forms, as opposed to INSERT forms like the current one.
``SQLFORM`` is the single biggest time-saver object in web2py.

The class ``SQLFORM`` is defined in "gluon/sqlhtml.py". It can be easily extended by overriding its ``xml`` method, the method that serializes the objects, to change its output.

``fields``:inxx ``labels``:inxx
The signature for the ``SQLFORM`` constructor is the following:
``
SQLFORM(table, record=None,
        deletable=False, linkto=None,
        upload=None, fields=None, labels=None,
        col3={}, submit_button='Submit',
        delete_label='Check to delete',
        showid=True, readonly=False,
        comments=True, keepopts=[],
        ignore_rw=False, record_id=None,
        formstyle='table3cols',
        buttons=['submit'], separator=': ',
        extra_fields=None,
        **attributes)

``:code
- The optional second argument turns the INSERT form into an UPDATE form for the specified record (see next subsection). ``showid``:inxx ``delete_label``:inxx ``id_label``:inxx ``submit_button``:inxx
- If ``deletable`` is set to ``True``, the UPDATE form displays a "Check to delete" checkbox. The value of the label for this field is set via the ``delete_label`` argument.
- ``submit_button`` sets the value of the submit button.
- ``id_label`` sets the label of the record "id"
- The "id" of the record is not shown if ``showid`` is set to ``False``.
- ``fields`` is an optional list of field names that you want to display. If a list is provided, only fields in the list are displayed. For example:
``
fields = ['name']
``:code
- ``labels`` is a dictionary of field labels. The dictionary key is a field name and the corresponding value is what gets displayed as its label. If a label is not provided, web2py derives the label from the field name (it capitalizes the field name and replaces underscores with spaces). For example:
``
labels = {'name':'Your Full Name:'}
``:code
- ``col3`` is a dictionary of values for the third column. For example:
``
col3 = {'name':A('what is this?',
      _href='http://www.google.com/search?q=define:name')}
``:code
- ``linkto`` and ``upload`` are optional URLs to user-defined controllers that allow the form to deal with reference fields. This is discussed in more detail later in [[Links to referencing records #Links-to-referencing-records]] and [[SQLFORM and uploads #SQLFORM-and-uploads]] sections respectively.
- ``readonly``. If set to True, displays the form as readonly
- ``comments``. If set to False, does not display the col3 comments
- ``ignore_rw``. Normally, for a create/update form, only fields marked as writable=True are shown, and for readonly forms, only fields marked as readable=True are shown. Setting ``ignore_rw=True`` causes those constraints to be ignored, and all fields are displayed. This is mostly used in the appadmin interface to display all fields for each table, overriding what the model indicates.
- ``formstyle``:inxx [[formstyle]] ``formstyle`` determines the style to be used when serializing the form in html. The default value is sourced from ``response.formstyle``, currently it is "bootstrap4_inline". Other options are "bootstrap4_stacked", "bootstrap3_inline, "bootstrap3_stacked", "bootstrap2", "table3cols", "table2cols" (one row for label and comment, and one row for input), "ul" (makes an unordered list of input fields), "divs" (represents the form using css friendly divs, for arbitrary customization), "bootstrap" which uses the bootstrap 2.3 form class "form-horizontal". ``formstyle`` can also be a function which generates everything inside the FORM tag. You pass to your form constructor function two arguments, form and fields. Hints can be found in the source code file sqlhtml.py (look for functions named formstyle_)
- ``buttons``:inxx ``buttons`` is a list of ``INPUT``s or ``BUTTON``s (though technically could be any combination of helpers) that will be added to a DIV where the submit button would go. 
For example, adding a URL-based back-button (for a multi-page form) and a renamed submit button:
``
buttons = [BUTTON('Back', _type="button", _onClick="parent.location='%s'" % URL(...),
           BUTTON('Next', _type="submit")]
``:code
or a button which links to another page:
``
buttons = [..., A("Go to another page", _class='btn', _href=URL("default", "anotherpage"))]
``:code
- ``separator``:inxx ``separator`` sets the string that separates form labels from form input fields, if set to None the default value is sourced from ``response.form_label_separator``
- ``extra_fields``:inxx ``extra_fields`` is a list of extra ``Field``s to add.
- Optional ``attributes`` are arguments starting with underscore that you want to pass to the ``FORM`` tag that renders the ``SQLFORM`` object. Examples are:
``
_action = '.'
_method = 'POST'
``:code

There is a special ``hidden`` attribute. When a dictionary is passed as ``hidden``, its items are translated into "hidden" INPUT fields (see the example for the ``FORM`` helper in [[Chapter 5 ../05#FORM]]).

``
form = SQLFORM(..., hidden=...)
``:code
causes the hidden fields to be passed  with the submission, no more, no less.
``form.accepts(...)`` is not
intended to read the received hidden fields and move them into
form.vars. The reason is security. Hidden fields can be tampered with.
So you have to explicitly move hidden fields from the request to the form:

``
form = SQLFORM(..., hidden=dict(a='b'))
form.vars.a = request.vars.a
``:code

#### The ``process`` method
``SQLFORM`` inherits the ``process`` method from ``FORM``.

#### ``SQLFORM`` and ``insert``/``update``/``delete``

``SQLFORM`` creates a new db record when the form is accepted. Assuming ``form = SQLFORM(db.test)``:code, then the id of the last-created record will be accessible in ``form.vars.id``.

``delete record``:inxx
If you pass a record as the optional second argument to the ``SQLFORM`` constructor, the form becomes an UPDATE form for that record. This means that when the form is submitted the existing record is updated and no new record is inserted. If you set the argument ``deletable=True``, the UPDATE form displays a "Check to delete" checkbox. If checked, the record is deleted.

------
If a form is submitted and the delete checkbox is checked the attribute
``form.deleted`` is set to ``True``.
------

You can modify the controller of the previous example so that when we pass an additional integer argument in the URL path, as in:
``
/test/default/display_form/2
``:code

and if there is a record with the corresponding id, the ``SQLFORM`` generates an UPDATE/DELETE form for the record:
``
def display_form():
   record = db.person(request.args(0)) or redirect(URL('index'))
   form = SQLFORM(db.person, record)
   if form.process().accepted:
       response.flash = 'form accepted'
   elif form.errors:
       response.flash = 'form has errors'
   return dict(form=form)
``:code

Line 2 finds the record and line 3 makes an UPDATE/DELETE form. Line 4 does all the corresponding form processing.

------
An update form is very similar to a create form except that it is pre-populated with the current record and it previews images. By default ``deletable = True`` which means the update form will display a "delete record" option.
------

Edit forms also contain a hidden INPUT field with ``name="id"`` which is used to identify the record. This id is also stored server-side for additional security and, if the visitor tampers with the value of this field, the UPDATE is not performed and web2py raises a SyntaxError, "user is tampering with form".

When a field is marked with ``writable=False``, the field is not shown in create forms, and it is shown readonly in update forms. If a field is marked as ``writable=False`` and ``readable=False``, then the field is not shown at all, not even in update forms.

Forms created with
``
form = SQLFORM(..., ignore_rw=True)
``:code

ignore the ``readable`` and ``writable`` attributes and always show all fields. Forms in ``appadmin`` ignore them by default.

Forms created with
``
form = SQLFORM(table, record_id, readonly=True)
``:code

always show all fields in readonly mode, and they cannot be accepted.

Marking a field with ``writable=False`` prevents the field from being part of the form, and causes the form processing to disregard the value of ``request.vars.field`` when processing the form.  However, if you assign a value to ``form.vars.field``, this value ''will'' be part of the insert or update when the form is processed. 
This enables you to change the value of fields that for some reason you do not wish to include in a form.


#### ``SQLFORM`` in HTML

There are times when you want to use ``SQLFORM`` to benefit from its form generation and processing, but you need a level of customization of the form in HTML that you cannot achieve with the parameters of the ``SQLFORM`` object, so you have to design the form using HTML.

Now, edit the previous controller and add a new action:
``
def display_manual_form():
    form = SQLFORM(db.person)
    if form.process(session=None, formname='test').accepted:
        response.flash = 'form accepted'
    elif form.errors:
        response.flash = 'form has errors'
    else:
        response.flash = 'please fill the form'
    # Note: no form instance is passed to the view
    return dict()
``:code

and insert the form in the associated "default/display_manual_form.html" view:
``
{{extend 'layout.html'}}
<form action="#" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
<ul>
  <li>Your name is <input name="name" /></li>
</ul>
  <input type="submit" />
  <input type="hidden" name="_formname" value="test" />
</form>
``:code

Notice that the action does not return the form because it does not need to pass it to the view. The view contains a form created manually in HTML. The form contains a hidden field "_formname" that must be the same ``formname`` specified as an argument of ``accepts`` in the action. web2py uses the form name in case there are multiple forms on the same page, to determine which one was submitted. If the page contains a single form, you can set ``formname=None`` and omit the hidden field in the view.

``form.accepts`` will look inside ``response.vars`` for data that matches fields in the database table ``db.person``.  These fields are declared in the HTML in the format
``<input name="field_name_goes_here" />
``:code

------
Note:
the HTML form uses ``POST`` protocol (i.e. form variables will not be passed on the URL) and ``multipart/form-data`` encoding type. The latter is needed for upload fields to work.
------

#### ``SQLFORM`` and uploads

Fields of type "upload" are special. They are rendered as INPUT fields of ``type="file"``. Unless otherwise specified, the uploaded file is streamed in using a buffer, and stored under the "uploads" folder of the application using a new safe name, assigned automatically. The name of this file is then saved into the field of type "upload".

As an example, consider the following model:
``
db.define_table('person',
    Field('name', requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
    Field('image', 'upload'))
``:code

You can use the same controller action "display_form" shown above.

When you insert a new record, the form allows you to browse for a file.
Choose, for example, a jpg image. The file is uploaded and stored as:
``
applications/test/uploads/person.image.XXXXX.jpg
``:code

"XXXXXX" is a random identifier for the file assigned by web2py.

``content-disposition``:inxx

-------
Notice that, by default, the original filename of an uploaded file is b16encoded and used to build the new name for the file. This name is retrieved by the default "download" action and used to set the content disposition header to the original filename.
-------

Only its extension is preserved. This is a security requirement since the filename may contain special characters that could allow a visitor to perform directory traversal attacks or other malicious operations.

The new filename is also stored in ``form.vars.image``.

When editing the record using an UPDATE form, it would be nice to display a link to the existing uploaded file, and web2py provides a way to do it.

If you pass a URL to the ``SQLFORM`` constructor via the ``upload`` argument, web2py uses the action at that URL to download the file. Consider the following actions:
``
def display_form():
   record = db.person(request.args(0))
   form = SQLFORM(db.person, record, deletable=True,
                  upload=URL('download'))
   if form.process().accepted:
       response.flash = 'form accepted'
   elif form.errors:
       response.flash = 'form has errors'
   return dict(form=form)

def download():
    return response.download(request, db)
``:code

Now, insert a new record at the URL:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/test/default/display_form
``:code

Upload an image, submit the form, and then edit the newly created record
by visiting:
``
http://127.0.0.1:8000/test/default/display_form/3
``:code

(here we assume the latest record has id=3). The form will display an image preview as shown below:

[[image @///image/en6300.png center 300px]]

This form, when serialized, generates the following HTML:
``
<td><label id="person_image__label" for="person_image">Image: </label></td>
<td><div><input type="file" id="person_image" class="upload" name="image"
/>[<a href="/test/default/download/person.image.0246683463831.jpg">file</a>|
<input type="checkbox" name="image__delete" />delete]</div></td><td></td></tr>
<tr id="delete_record__row"><td><label id="delete_record__label" for="delete_record"
>Check to delete:</label></td><td><input type="checkbox" id="delete_record"
class="delete" name="delete_this_record" /></td>
``:code

which contains a link to allow downloading of the uploaded file, and a checkbox to remove the file from the database record, thus storing NULL in the "image" field.

Why is this mechanism exposed? Why do you need to write the download function? Because you may want to enforce some authorization mechanism in the download function. See [[Chapter 9 ../09#Authorization-and-downloads]] for an example.

Normally uploaded files are stored into "app/uploads" but you can specify an alternate location:
``
Field('image', 'upload', uploadfolder='...')
``
In most operating system, accessing the file system can become slow when there are many files in the same folder. If you plan to upload more than 1000 files you can ask web2py to organize the uploads in subfolders:
``
Field('image', 'upload', uploadseparate=True)
``


#### Storing the original filename

web2py automatically stores the original filename inside the new UUID filename and retrieves it when the file is downloaded. Upon download, the original filename is stored in the content-disposition header of the HTTP response. This is all done transparently without the need for programming.

Occasionally you may want to store the original filename in a database field. In this case, you need to modify the model and add a field to store it in:
``
db.define_table('person',
    Field('name', requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
    Field('image_filename'),
    Field('image', 'upload'))
``:code

Then you need to modify the controller to handle it:

``
def display_form():
    record = db.person(request.args(0)) or redirect(URL('index'))
    url = URL('download')
    form = SQLFORM(db.person, record, deletable=True,
                   upload=url, fields=['name', 'image'])
    if request.vars.image != None:
        form.vars.image_filename = request.vars.image.filename
    if form.process().accepted:
        response.flash = 'form accepted'
    elif form.errors:
        response.flash = 'form has errors'
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

Notice that the ``SQLFORM`` does not display the "image_filename" field.
The "display_form" action moves the filename of the ``request.vars.image``
into the ``form.vars.image_filename``, so that it gets processed by ``accepts`` and
stored in the database. The download function, before serving the file, checks in the database for the original filename and uses it in the content-disposition header.

#### ``autodelete``
``autodelete``:inxx

The ``SQLFORM``, upon deleting a record, does not delete the physical uploaded file(s) referenced by the record. The reason is that web2py does not know whether the same file is used/linked by other tables or used for other purpose. If you know it is safe to delete the actual file when the corresponding record is deleted, you can do the following:
``
db.define_table('image',
    Field('name', requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
    Field('source', 'upload', autodelete=True))
``:code

The ``autodelete`` attribute is ``False`` by default. When set to ``True`` is makes sure the file is deleted when the record is deleted.

#### Links to referencing records

Now consider the case of two tables linked by a reference field. For example:
``
db.define_table('person',
    Field('name', requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
db.define_table('dog',
    Field('owner', 'reference person'),
    Field('name', requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()))
db.dog.owner.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, 'person.id', '%(name)s')
``:code

A person has dogs, and each dog belongs to an owner, which is a person. The dog owner is required to reference a valid ``db.person.id`` by ``'%(name)s'``.

Let's use the **appadmin** interface for this application to add a
few persons and their dogs.

When editing an existing person, the **appadmin** UPDATE form shows a link to a page that lists the dogs that belong to the person. This behavior can be replicated using the ``linkto`` argument of the ``SQLFORM``. ``linkto`` has to point to the URL of a new action that receives a query string from the ``SQLFORM`` and lists the corresponding records.
Here is an example:
``
def display_form():
   record = db.person(request.args(0)) or redirect(URL('index'))
   link = URL('list_records', args='db')
   form = SQLFORM(db.person, record, deletable=True, linkto=link)
   if form.process().accepted:
       response.flash = 'form accepted'
   elif form.errors:
       response.flash = 'form has errors'
   return dict(form=form)
``:code

Here is the page:

[[image @///image/en6400.png center 300px]]

There is a link called "dog.owner". The name of this link can be changed via the ``labels`` argument of the ``SQLFORM``, for example:
``
labels = {'dog.owner':"This person's dogs"}
``:code

If you click on the link you get directed to:
``
/test/default/list_records/db/dog?query=db.dog.owner%3D%3D3
``:code

"list_records" is the specified action, with ``request.args(0)`` set to the name of the referencing table and ``request.vars.query`` set to the SQL query string.
The query string in the URL
contains the value "dog.owner==3" appropriately url-encoded
(web2py decodes this automatically when the URL is parsed).

You can easily implement a very general "list_records" action as follows:
``
def list_records():
    import re
    REGEX = re.compile(r'^(\w+)\.(\w+)\.(\w+)==(\d+)$')
    match = REGEX.match(request.vars.query)
    if not match:
        redirect(URL('error'))
    table, field, id = match.group(2), match.group(3), match.group(4)
    records = db(db[table][field]==id).select()
    return dict(records=records)
``:code

with the associated "default/list_records.html" view:
``
{{extend 'layout.html'}}
{{=records}}
``:code

When a set of records is returned by a select and serialized in a view, it is first converted into a SQLTABLE object (not the same as a Table) and then serialized into an HTML table, where each field corresponds to a table column.

#### Pre-populating the form
It is always possible to pre-populate a form using the syntax:
``
form.vars.name = 'fieldvalue'
``:code

Statements like the one above must be inserted after the form declaration and before the form is accepted, whether or not the field ("name" in the example) is explicitly visualized in the form.

#### Adding extra form elements to ``SQLFORM``
Sometimes you may wish to add an extra element to your form after it has been created. For example, you may wish to add a checkbox which confirms the user agrees with the terms and conditions of your website:
``
form = SQLFORM(db.yourtable)
my_extra_element = TR(LABEL('I agree to the terms and conditions'),
                      INPUT(_name='agree', value=True, _type='checkbox'))
form[0].insert(-1, my_extra_element)
``:code

The variable ``my_extra_element`` should be adapted to the formstyle. In this example, the default ``formstyle='table3cols'`` has been assumed.

After submission, ``form.vars.agree`` will contain the status of the checkbox, which could then be used in an ``onvalidation`` function, for instance.

#### ``SQLFORM`` without database IO

There are times when you want to generate a form from a database table using ``SQLFORM`` and you want to validate a submitted form accordingly, but you do not want any automatic INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE in the database. This is the case, for example, when one of the fields needs to be computed from the value of other input fields. This is also the case when you need to perform additional validation on the inserted data that cannot be achieved via standard validators.

This can be done easily by breaking:
``
form = SQLFORM(db.person)
if form.process().accepted:
    response.flash = 'record inserted'
``:code

into:
``
form = SQLFORM(db.person)
if form.validate():
    ### deal with uploads explicitly
    form.vars.id = db.person.insert(**dict(form.vars))
    response.flash = 'record inserted'
``:code

The same can be done for UPDATE/DELETE forms by breaking:
``
form = SQLFORM(db.person, record)
if form.process().accepted:
    response.flash = 'record updated'
``:code

into:
``
form = SQLFORM(db.person, record)
if form.validate():
    if form.deleted:
        db(db.person.id==record.id).delete()
    else:
        form.record.update_record(**dict(form.vars))
    response.flash = 'record updated'
``:code

In the case of a table including an "upload"-type field ("fieldname"), both ``process(dbio=False)`` and ``validate()`` deal with the storage of the uploaded file as if ``process(dbio=True)``, the default behavior.

The name assigned by web2py to the uploaded file can be found in:
``
form.vars.fieldname
``:code

### Other types of Forms

#### ``SQLFORM.factory``

There are cases when you want to generate forms ''as if'' you had a database table but you do not want the database table. You simply want to take advantage of the ``SQLFORM`` capability to generate a nice looking CSS-friendly form and perhaps perform file upload and renaming.

This can be done via a ``form_factory``. Here is an example where you generate the form, perform validation, upload a file and store everything in the ``session`` :
``
def form_from_factory():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(
        Field('your_name', requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
        Field('your_image', 'upload'))
    if form.process().accepted:
        response.flash = 'form accepted'
        session.your_name = form.vars.your_name
        session.your_image = form.vars.your_image
    elif form.errors:
        response.flash = 'form has errors'
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

The Field object in the SQLFORM.factory() constructor is fully documented in [[Chapter 6 ../06#Field-constructor]].
A run-time construction technique for SQLFORM.factory() is
``
fields = []
fields.append(Field(...))
form=SQLFORM.factory(*fields)
``:code

Here is the "default/form_from_factory.html" view:
``
{{extend 'layout.html'}}
{{=form}}
``:code

You cannot use space into field names, set labels explicitly in field constructors (i.e. ``Field('field_name', ..., label='...')``) or pass a dictionary of ``labels`` to ``form_factory``, as you would for a ``SQLFORM``. By default ``SQLFORM.factory`` generates the form using HTML "id" attributes generated as if the form was generated from a table called "no_table". To change this dummy table name, use the ``table_name`` argument:
``
form = SQLFORM.factory(..., table_name='other_dummy_name')
``:code

Changing the ``table_name`` is necessary if you need to place two factory generated forms in the same table and want to avoid CSS conflicts.

##### Uploading files with SQLFORM.factory


#### One form for multiple tables

It often happens that you have two tables (for example 'client' and
'address' which are linked together by a reference and you want to
create a single form that allows to insert info about one client and
its default address. Here is how:

model:
``
db.define_table('client',
     Field('name'))
db.define_table('address',
    Field('client', 'reference client',
          writable=False, readable=False),
    Field('street'), Field('city'))
``:code

controller:
``
def register():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(db.client, db.address)
    if form.process().accepted:
        id = db.client.insert(**db.client._filter_fields(form.vars))
        form.vars.client = id
        id = db.address.insert(**db.address._filter_fields(form.vars))
        response.flash = 'Thanks for filling the form'
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

Notice the SQLFORM.factory (it makes ONE form using public fields from
both tables and inherits their validators too).
On form accepts this does two inserts, some data in one table and some
data in the other.

-------
This only works when the tables don't have field names in common.
-------


#### Confirmation Forms

``confirm``:inxx

Often you need a form with a confirmation choice. The form should be accepted if the choice is accepted, that is on submission only. The form may have additional options that link other web pages. web2py provides a simple way to do this:

``
form = FORM.confirm('Are you sure?')
if form.accepted: do_what_needs_to_be_done()
``:code

Notice that the confirm form does not need and must not call ``.accepts`` or ``.process`` because this is done internally. You can add buttons with links to the confirmation form in the form of a dictionary of ``{'value':'link'}``:

``
form = FORM.confirm('Are you sure?', {'Back':URL('other_page')})
if form.accepted: do_what_needs_to_be_done()
``:code

#### Form to edit a dictionary

Imagine a system that stores configurations options in a dictionary,

``
config = dict(color='black', language='English')
``:code

and you need a form to allow the visitor to modify this dictionary.
This can be done with:

``
form = SQLFORM.dictform(config)
if form.process().accepted: config.update(form.vars)
``:code

The form will display one INPUT field for each item in the dictionary. It will use dictionary keys as INPUT names and labels and current values to infer types (string, int, double, date, datetime, boolean).

This works great but leave to you the logic of making the config dictionary persistent. For example you may want to store the ``config`` in a session.

``
if not session.config:
    session.config = dict(color='black', language='English')
form = SQLFORM.dictform(session.config)
if form.process().accepted:
    session.config.update(form.vars)
``:code


### CRUD
``CRUD``:inxx ``crud.create``:inxx ``crud.update``:inxx ``crud.select``:inxx ``crud.search``:inxx ``crud.tables``:inxx ``crud.delete``:inxx

The Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) API is an experimental interface on top of SQLFORM.  It is now deprecated in favor of 
[[SQLFORM.grid() and SQLFORM.smartgrid() #SQLFORM-grid-and-SQLFORM-smartgrid]], 
but is described here because some applications have been built with it.

CRUD creates an SQLFORM, but it simplifies the coding because it incorporates the creation of the form, the processing of the form, the notification, and the redirection, all in one single function.
The first thing to notice is that CRUD differs from the other web2py APIs we have used so far because it is not already exposed. It must be imported. It also must be linked to a specific database. For example:
``
from gluon.tools import Crud
crud = Crud(db)
``:code

The ``crud`` object defined above provides the following API:

``crud.tables``:inxx ``crud.create``:inxx ``crud.read``:inxx ``crud.update``:inxx ``crud.delete``:inxx ``crud.select``:inxx .
- ``crud.tables()`` returns a list of tables defined in the database.
- ``crud.create(db.tablename)`` returns a create form for table tablename.
- ``crud.read(db.tablename, id)`` returns a readonly form for tablename and record id.
- ``crud.update(db.tablename, id)`` returns an update form for tablename and record id.
- ``crud.delete(db.tablename, id)`` deletes the record.
- ``crud.select(db.tablename, query)`` returns a list of records selected from the table.
- ``crud.search(db.tablename)`` returns a tuple (form, records) where form is a search form and records is a list of records based on the submitted search form.
- ``crud()`` returns one of the above based on the ``request.args()``.

For example, the following action:
``
def data(): return dict(form=crud())
``:code

would expose the following URLs:
``
http://.../[app]/[controller]/data/tables
http://.../[app]/[controller]/data/create/[tablename]
http://.../[app]/[controller]/data/read/[tablename]/[id]
http://.../[app]/[controller]/data/update/[tablename]/[id]
http://.../[app]/[controller]/data/delete/[tablename]/[id]
http://.../[app]/[controller]/data/select/[tablename]
http://.../[app]/[controller]/data/search/[tablename]
``:code

However, the following action:

``
def create_tablename():
    return dict(form=crud.create(db.tablename))
``:code

would only expose the create method

``
http://.../[app]/[controller]/create_tablename
``:code

While the following action:

``
def update_tablename():
    return dict(form=crud.update(db.tablename, request.args(0)))
``:code

would only expose the update method

``
http://.../[app]/[controller]/update_tablename/[id]
``:code

and so on.

The behavior of CRUD can be customized in two ways: by setting some attributes of the ``crud`` object or by passing extra parameters to each of its methods.

#### Settings

Here is a complete list of current CRUD attributes, their default values, and meaning:

To enforce authentication on all crud forms:

``
crud.settings.auth = auth
``:code
This is explained in [[Chapter 9 ../09#Authorization-and-CRUD]].

To specify the controller that defines the ``data`` function which returns the ``crud`` object

``
crud.settings.controller = 'default'
``:code

To specify the URL to redirect to after a successful "create" record:

``
crud.settings.create_next = URL('index')
``:code

To specify the URL to redirect to after a successful "update" record:

``
crud.settings.update_next = URL('index')
``:code

To specify the URL to redirect to after a successful "delete" record:

``
crud.settings.delete_next = URL('index')
``:code

To specify the URL to be used for linking uploaded files:

``
crud.settings.download_url = URL('download')
``:code

To specify extra functions to be executed after standard validation procedures for ``crud.create`` forms:

``
crud.settings.create_onvalidation = StorageList()
``:code

``StorageList`` is the same as a ``Storage`` object, they are both defined in the file "gluon/storage.py", but it defaults to ``[]`` as opposed to ``None``. It allows the following syntax:

``
crud.settings.create_onvalidation.mytablename.append(lambda form: ...)
``:code

To specify extra functions to be executed after standard validation procedures for ``crud.update`` forms:

``
crud.settings.update_onvalidation = StorageList()
``:code

To specify extra functions to be executed after completion of ``crud.create`` forms:

``
crud.settings.create_onaccept = StorageList()
``:code

To specify extra functions to be executed after completion of ``crud.update`` forms:

``
crud.settings.update_onaccept = StorageList()
``:code

To specify extra functions to be executed after completion of ``crud.update`` if record is deleted:

``
crud.settings.update_ondelete = StorageList()
``:code

To specify extra functions to be executed after completion of ``crud.delete``:

``
crud.settings.delete_onaccept = StorageList()
``:code

To determine whether the "update" forms should have a "delete" button:

``
crud.settings.update_deletable = True
``:code

To determine whether the "update" forms should show the id of the edited record:

``
crud.settings.showid = False
``:code

To determine whether forms should keep the previously inserted values or reset to default after successful submission:

``
crud.settings.keepvalues = False
``:code

Crud always detects whether a record being edited has been modified by a third party in the time between the time when the form is displayed and the time when it is submitted. This behavior is equivalent to
``
form.process(detect_record_change=True)``

and it is set in:

``
crud.settings.detect_record_change = True
``:code
and it can be changed/disabled by setting the variable to ``False``.

You can change the form style by

``
crud.settings.formstyle = 'table3cols' or 'table2cols' or 'divs' or 'ul'
``:code

You can set the separator in all crud forms:

``
crud.settings.label_separator = ':'
``:code

#### captcha

You can add captcha to forms, using the same convention explained for ``auth.settings`` (see [[Chapter 9 ../09#captcha_settings]]), with:

``
crud.settings.create_captcha = None
crud.settings.update_captcha = None
crud.settings.captcha = None
``:code


#### Messages

Here is a list of customizable messages:
``
crud.messages.submit_button = 'Submit'
``:code

sets the text of the "submit" button for both create and update forms.
``
crud.messages.delete_label = 'Check to delete'
``:code

sets the label of the "delete" checkbox in "update" forms.
``
crud.messages.record_created = 'Record Created'
``:code

sets the flash message on successful record creation.
``
crud.messages.record_updated = 'Record Updated'
``:code

sets the flash message on successful record update.
``
crud.messages.record_deleted = 'Record Deleted'
``:code

sets the flash message on successful record deletion.
``
crud.messages.update_log = 'Record %(id)s updated'
``:code

sets the log message on successful record update.
``
crud.messages.create_log = 'Record %(id)s created'
``:code

sets the log message on successful record creation.
``
crud.messages.read_log = 'Record %(id)s read'
``:code

sets the log message on successful record read access.
``
crud.messages.delete_log = 'Record %(id)s deleted'
``:code

sets the log message on successful record deletion.

------
Notice that ``crud.messages`` belongs to the class ``gluon.storage.Message`` which is similar to ``gluon.storage.Storage`` but it automatically translates its values, without need for the ``T`` operator.
------

Log messages are used if and only if CRUD is connected to Auth (as discussed in [[Chapter 9 ../09#Authorization-and-CRUD]]) and CRUD logger is attached too:

``
crud.settings.logger = crud.settings.auth = auth
``:code
The events are logged in the Auth table ``auth_event``.

#### Methods

The behavior of CRUD methods can also be customized on a per call basis. Here are their signatures:
``
crud.tables()
crud.create(table, next, onvalidation, onaccept, log, message, formname, **attributes)
crud.read(table, record)
crud.update(table, record, next, onvalidation, onaccept, ondelete, log, message, deletable)
crud.delete(table, record_id, next, message)
crud.select(table, query, fields, orderby, limitby, headers, **attr)
crud.search(table, query, queries, query_labels, fields, field_labels, zero, showall, chkall)
``:code
- ``table`` is a DAL table or a tablename the method should act on.
- ``record`` and ``record_id`` are the id of the record the method should act on.
- ``next`` is the URL to redirect to after success. If the URL contains the substring "[id]" this will be replaced by the id of the record currently created/updated (use ``URL(..., url_encode=False)`` to prevent the brackets from being escaped).
- ``onvalidation`` has the same function as in FORM and SQLFORM (see [[onvalidation #onvalidation]] section)
- ``onaccept`` is a function to be called after the form submission is accepted and acted upon, but before redirection. This will be called with the form passed as argument.
- ``log`` is the log message. Log messages in CRUD see variables in the ``form.vars`` dictionary such as "%(id)s" (the message actually logged is ``log % form.vars``).
- ``message`` is the flash message upon form acceptance.
- ``formname`` is the name to be used for the genarated SQLFORM, this may be needed when you want multiple form on the same page (see [[Multiple forms per page #Multiple-forms-per-page]] section for additional details).
- ``**attributes`` additional ``crud.create`` and ``crud.update`` keyword arguments to be passed to the ``SQLFORM`` constructor.
- ``ondelete`` is called in place of ``onaccept`` when a record is deleted via an "update" form.
- ``deletable`` determines whether the "update" form should have a delete option.
- ``query`` is the query to be used to select records.
- ``fields`` is a list of fields to be selected.
- ``orderby`` determines the order in which records should be selected (see [[Chapter 6 ../06#orderby]]).
- ``limitby`` determines the range of selected records that should be displayed (see [[Chapter 6 ../06#limitby]]).
- ``headers`` is a dictionary mapping field names into header names to be passed to the ``SQLTABLE`` constructor (see [[Chapter 6 ../06#sqltable]]).
- ``queries`` a list like ``['equals', 'not equal', 'contains']`` containing the allowed methods in the search form.
- ``query_labels`` a dictionary like ``query_labels=dict(equals='Equals')`` giving names to search methods.
- ``fields`` a list of fields to be listed in the search widget.
- ``field_labels`` a dictionary mapping field names into labels.
- ``zero`` defaults to "choose one" is used as default option for the drop-down in the search widget.
- ``showall`` set it to True if you want rows returned as per the query in the first call (added after 1.98.2).
- ``chkall`` set it to True to turn on all the checkboxes in the search form (added after 1.98.2).
- ``**attr`` additional ``crud.select`` keyword arguments to be passed to the ``SQLTABLE`` constructor (see [[Chapter 6 ../06#sqltable]]).

Here is an example of usage in a single controller function:
``
## assuming db.define_table('person', Field('name'))
def people():
    form = crud.create(db.person, next=URL('index'),
                       message=T("record created"))
    persons = crud.select(db.person, fields=['name'],
                          headers={'person.name': 'Name'})
    return dict(form=form, persons=persons)
``:code

Here is another very generic controller function that lets you search, create and edit any records from any table where the tablename is passed in request.args(0):
``
def manage():
    table = db[request.args(0)]
    form = crud.update(table, request.args(1))
    table.id.represent = lambda id, row: \\
       A('edit:', id, _href=URL(args=(request.args(0), id)))
    search, rows = crud.search(table)
    return dict(form=form, search=search, rows=rows)
``:code

Notice the line ``table.id.represent=...`` that tells web2py to change the representation of the id field and display a link instead to the page itself and passes the id as request.args(1) which turns the create page into an update page.

#### Record versioning

Both SQLFORM and CRUD provides a utility to version database records:

If you have a table (db.mytable) that needs full revision history you can just do:
``
form = SQLFORM(db.mytable, myrecord).process(onsuccess=auth.archive)
``:code

``
form = crud.update(db.mytable, myrecord, onaccept=auth.archive)
``:code

``auth.archive`` defines a new table called **db.mytable_archive** (the name is derived from the name of the table to which it refers) and on updating, it stores a copy of the record (as it was before the update) in the created archive table, including a reference to the current record.

Because the record is actually updated (only its previous state is archived), references are never broken.

This is all done under the hood.  Should you wish to access the archive table you should define it in a model:
``
db.define_table('mytable_archive',
   Field('current_record', 'reference mytable'),
   db.mytable)
``:code

Notice the table extends ``db.mytable`` (including all its fields), and adds  a reference to the ``current_record``.

``auth.archive`` does not timestamp the stored record unless your original table has timestamp fields, for example:

``
db.define_table('mytable',
    Field('created_on', 'datetime',
          default=request.now, update=request.now, writable=False),
    Field('created_by', 'reference auth_user',
          default=auth.user_id, update=auth.user_id, writable=False),
``:code

There is nothing special about these fields and you may give them any name you like. They are filled before the record is archived and are archived with each copy of the record.  The archive table name and/or reference field name can be changed like this:

``
db.define_table('myhistory',
    Field('parent_record', 'reference mytable'),
    db.mytable)
## ...
form = SQLFORM(db.mytable, myrecord)
form.process(onsuccess = lambda form:auth.archive(form,
             archive_table=db.myhistory,
             current_record='parent_record'))
``:code

### Custom forms

If a form is created with SQLFORM, SQLFORM.factory or CRUD, there are multiple ways it can be embedded in a view allowing multiple degrees of customization. Consider for example the following model:
``
db.define_table('image',
    Field('name', requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
    Field('source', 'upload'))
``:code

and upload action
``
def upload_image():
    return dict(form=SQLFORM(db.image).process())
``:code

The simplest way to embed the form in the view for ``upload_image`` is
``
{{=form}}
``:code

This results in a standard table layout. If you wish to use a different layout, you can break the form into components
``
{{=form.custom.begin}}
Name: <div>{{=form.custom.widget.name}}</div>
File: <div>{{=form.custom.widget.source}}</div>
{{=form.custom.submit}}
{{=form.custom.end}}
``:code

where ``form.custom.widget[fieldname]`` gets serialized into the proper widget for the field. If the form is submitted and it contains errors, they are appended below the widgets, as usual.

The above sample form is show in the image below.

[[image @///image/en6500.png center 300px]]

A similar result could have been obtained without using a custom form:

``
SQLFORM(..., formstyle='table2cols')
``:code

or in case of CRUD forms with the following parameter:

``
crud.settings.formstyle='table2cols'
``:code

See description for ``formstyle`` argument of [[SQLFORM #formstyle]] for other possible values.

If you do not wish to use the widgets serialized by web2py, you can replace them with HTML. There are some variables that will be useful for this:
- ``form.custom.label[fieldname]`` contains the label for the field.
- ``form.custom.comment[fieldname]`` contains the comment for the field.
- ``form.custom.dspval[fieldname]`` form-type and field-type dependent display representation of the field.
- ``form.custom.inpval[fieldname]`` form-type and field-type dependent values to be used in field code.

If your form has ``deletable=True`` you should also insert

``
{{=form.custom.delete}}
``:code

to display the delete checkbox.

It is important to follow the conventions described below.

#### CSS conventions

Tags in forms generated by SQLFORM, SQLFORM.factory and CRUD follow a strict CSS naming convention that can be used to further customize the forms.

Given a table "mytable", and a field "myfield" of type "string", it is rendered by default by a
``
SQLFORM.widgets.string.widget
``:code

that looks like this:
``
<input type="text" name="myfield" id="mytable_myfield"
       class="string" />
``:code

Notice that:
- the class of the INPUT tag is the same as the type of the field. This is very important for the jQuery code in "web2py_ajax.html" to work. It makes sure that you can only have numbers in "integer" and "double" fields, and that "time", "date" and "datetime" fields display the popup calendar/datepicker.
- the id is the name of the class plus the name of the field, joined by one underscore. This allows you to uniquely refer to the field via, for example, ``jQuery('#mytable_myfield')`` and manipulate the stylesheet of the field or bind actions associated to the field events (focus, blur, keyup, etc.).
- the name is, as you would expect, the field name.

#### Hide errors
``hideerror``:inxx

Occasionally, you may want to disable the automatic error placement and display form error messages in some place other than the default. That can be done easily.

- In the case of FORM or SQLFORM, pass ``hideerror=True`` to the ``accepts`` method.
- In the case of CRUD, set ``crud.settings.hideerror=True``

You may also want to modify the views to display the error (since they are no longer displayed automatically).

Here is an example where the errors are displayed above the form and not in the form.
``
{{if form.errors:}}
  Your submitted form contains the following errors:
  <ul>
  {{for fieldname in form.errors:}}
    <li>{{=fieldname}} error: {{=form.errors[fieldname]}}</li>
  {{pass}}
  </ul>
  {{form.errors.clear()}}
{{pass}}
{{=form}}
``:code

The errors will displayed as in the image shown below.

[[image @///image/en6600.png center 300px]]

This mechanism also works for custom forms.


### Validators
``validators``:inxx

Validators are classes used to validate input fields (including forms generated from database tables).
With the advanced forms derived from SQLFORM, validators create widgets such as drop-down menus and lookups from other tables.

Here is an example of using a validator with a ``FORM`` field:
``
INPUT(_name='a', requires=IS_INT_IN_RANGE(0, 10))
``:code

Here is an example of how to require a validator for a table field:
``
db.define_table('person', Field('name'))
db.person.name.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY()
``:code

Validators are always assigned using the ``requires`` attribute of a field. A field can have a single validator or multiple validators. Multiple validators are made part of a list:
``
db.person.name.requires = [IS_NOT_EMPTY(),
                           IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, 'person.name')]
``:code

Normally validators are called automatically by the function ``accepts`` and ``process`` of a ``FORM`` or other HTML helper object that contains a form. They are called in the order in which they are listed.

One can also call validators explicitly for a field:

``
db.person.name.validate(value)
``

which returns a tuple ``(value, error)`` and ``error`` is ``None`` if the value validates.

Built-in validators have constructors that take an optional argument:

``
IS_NOT_EMPTY(error_message='cannot be empty')
``:code

``error_message`` allows you to override the default error message for any validator.

Here is an example of a validator on a database table:
``
db.person.name.requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY(error_message='fill this!')
``:code

where we have used the translation operator ``T`` to allow for internationalization. Notice that default error messages are not translated.

Mind that the only validators that can be used with ``list:`` type fields are:

- ``IS_IN_DB(..., multiple=True)``
- ``IS_IN_SET(..., multiple=True)``
- ``IS_NOT_EMPTY()``
- ``IS_LIST_OF_EMAILS()``
- ``IS_LIST_OF(...)``

The latter can be used to apply any validator to the individual items in the list. ``multiple=(1, 1000)`` requires a selection of between 1 and 1000 items. This enforces selection of at least one choice. 

#### Text format validators

##### ``IS_ALPHANUMERIC``
``IS_ALPHANUMERIC``:inxx

This validator checks that a field value contains only characters in the ranges a-z, A-Z, or 0-9.
``
requires = IS_ALPHANUMERIC(error_message='must be alphanumeric!')
``:code

##### ``IS_LOWER``
``IS_LOWER``:inxx

This validator never returns an error. It just converts the value to lower case.
``
requires = IS_LOWER()
``:code

##### ``IS_UPPER``
``IS_UPPER``:inxx

This validator never returns an error. It converts the value to upper case.
``
requires = IS_UPPER()
``:code


##### ``IS_EMAIL``
``IS_EMAIL``:inxx

It checks that the field value looks like an email address. It does not try to send email to confirm.
``
requires = IS_EMAIL(error_message='invalid email!')
``:code

##### ``IS_MATCH``
``IS_MATCH``:inxx

This validator matches the value against a regular expression and returns an error if it does not match.
Here is an example of usage to validate a US zip code:
``
requires = IS_MATCH('^\d{5}(-\d{4})?$',
         error_message='not a zip code')
``:code

Here is an example of usage to validate an IPv4 address (note: the IS_IPV4 validator is more appropriate for this purpose):
``
requires = IS_MATCH('^\d{1,3}(\.\d{1,3}){3}$',
         error_message='not an IP address')
``:code

Here is an example of usage to validate a US phone number:
``
requires = IS_MATCH('^1?((-)\d{3}-?|\(\d{3}\))\d{3}-?\d{4}$',
         error_message='not a phone number')
``:code

For more information on Python regular expressions, refer to the official Python documentation.

``IS_MATCH`` takes an optional argument ``strict`` which defaults to ``False``. When set to ``True`` it only matches the whole string (from the beginning to the end):

``
>>> IS_MATCH('ab', strict=False)('abc')
('abc', None)
>>> IS_MATCH('ab', strict=True)('abc')
('abc', 'Invalid expression')

``

``IS_MATCH`` takes an other optional argument ``search`` which defaults to ``False``. When set to ``True``, it uses regex method ``search`` instead of method ``match`` to validate the string.

``IS_MATCH('...', extract=True)`` filters and extract only the first matching
substring rather than the original value.

##### ``IS_LENGTH``
``IS_LENGTH``:inxx

Checks if length of field's value fits between given boundaries. Works
for both text and file inputs.

Its arguments are:
- maxsize: the maximum allowed length / size (has default = 255)
- minsize: the minimum allowed length / size

Examples:
Check if text string is shorter than 33 characters:
``
INPUT(_type='text', _name='name', requires=IS_LENGTH(32))
``:code

Check if password string is longer than 5 characters:
``
INPUT(_type='password', _name='name', requires=IS_LENGTH(minsize=6))
``:code

Check if uploaded file has size between 1KB and 1MB:
``
INPUT(_type='file', _name='name', requires=IS_LENGTH(1048576, 1024))
``:code

For all field types except for files, it checks the length of the value. In the case of files, the value is a ``cgi.FieldStorage``, so it validates the length of the data in the file, which is the behavior one might intuitively expect.

##### ``IS_URL``
``IS_URL``:inxx

Rejects a URL string if any of the following is true:
- The string is empty or None
- The string uses characters that are not allowed in a URL
- The string breaks any of the HTTP syntactic rules
- The URL scheme specified (if one is specified) is not 'http' or 'https'
- The top-level domain (if a host name is specified) does not exist

(These rules are based on RFC 2616``RFC2616``:cite )

This function only checks the URL's syntax. It does not check that the URL points to a real document,
for example, or that it otherwise makes semantic sense. This function does automatically prepend
'http://' in front of a URL in the case of an abbreviated URL (e.g. 'google.ca').

If the parameter mode='generic' is used, then this function's behavior changes. It then rejects a URL string if any of the following is true:
- The string is empty or None
- The string uses characters that are not allowed in a URL
- The URL scheme specified (if one is specified) is not valid

(These rules are based on RFC 2396``RFC2396``:cite )

The list of allowed schemes is customizable with the allowed_schemes parameter. If you exclude None from
the list, then abbreviated URLs (lacking a scheme such as 'http') will be rejected.

The default prepended scheme is customizable with the prepend_scheme parameter. If you set prepend_scheme
to None, then prepending will be disabled. URLs that require prepending to parse will still be accepted,
but the return value will not be modified.

IS_URL is compatible with the Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) standard specified in RFC 3490``RFC3490``:cite ). As a result, URLs can be regular strings or unicode strings.
If the URL's domain component (e.g. google.ca) contains non-US-ASCII letters, then the domain will
be converted into Punycode (defined in RFC 3492``RFC3492``:cite ). IS_URL goes a
bit beyond the standards, and allows non-US-ASCII characters to be present in the path
and query components of the URL as well. These non-US-ASCII characters will be encoded.
For example, space will be encoded as'%20'. The unicode character with hex code 0x4e86
will become '%4e%86'.

Examples:
``
requires = IS_URL())
requires = IS_URL(mode='generic')
requires = IS_URL(allowed_schemes=['https'])
requires = IS_URL(prepend_scheme='https')
requires = IS_URL(mode='generic',
                  allowed_schemes=['ftps', 'https'],
                  prepend_scheme='https')
``:code

##### ``IS_SLUG``
``IS_SLUG``:inxx
``
requires = IS_SLUG(maxlen=80, check=False, error_message='must be slug')
``:code

If ``check`` is set to ``True`` it check whether the validated value is a slug (allowing only alphanumeric characters and non-repeated dashes).

If ``check`` is set to ``False`` (default) it converts the input value to a slug.

##### ``IS_JSON``
``IS_JSON``:inxx
``
requires = IS_JSON(error_message='Invalid json', native_json=False)
``:code

This validator checks that a field value is in JSON format.

If ``native_json`` is set to ``False`` (default) it converts the input value to the serialized value otherwise the input value is left unchanged.

#### Date and time validators

##### ``IS_TIME``
``IS_TIME``:inxx

This validator checks that a field value contains a valid time in the specified format.
``
requires = IS_TIME(error_message='must be HH:MM:SS!')
``:code

##### ``IS_DATE``
``IS_DATE``:inxx

This validator checks that a field value contains a valid date in the specified format. It is good practice to specify the format using the translation operator, in order to support different formats in different locales.
``
requires = IS_DATE(format=T('%Y-%m-%d'),
                   error_message='must be YYYY-MM-DD!')
``:code

For the full description on % directives look under the IS_DATETIME validator.

##### ``IS_DATETIME``
``IS_DATETIME``:inxx

This validator checks that a field value contains a valid datetime in the specified format. It is good practice to specify the format using the translation operator, in order to support different formats in different locales.
``
requires = IS_DATETIME(format=T('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'),
                       error_message='must be YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS!')
``:code

The following symbols can be used for the format string (this shows the symbol, their meaning, and an example string):
``
%Y  year with century (e.g. '1963')
%y  year without century (e.g. '63')
%d  day of the month (e.g. '28')
%m  month (e.g '08')
%b  abbreviated month name (e.g.'Aug')
%B  full month name (e.g. 'August')
%H  hour (24-hour clock, e.g. '14')
%I  hour (12-hour clock, e.g. '02')
%p  either 'AM' or 'PM'
%M  minute (e.g. '30')
%S  second (e.g. '59')
``:code

##### ``IS_DATE_IN_RANGE``
``IS_DATE_IN_RANGE``:inxx

Works very much like the previous validator but allows to specify a range:
``
requires = IS_DATE_IN_RANGE(format=T('%Y-%m-%d'),
                   minimum=datetime.date(2008, 1, 1),
                   maximum=datetime.date(2009, 12, 31),
                   error_message='must be YYYY-MM-DD!')
``:code

For the full description on % directives look under the IS_DATETIME validator.

##### ``IS_DATETIME_IN_RANGE``
``IS_DATETIME_IN_RANGE``:inxx

Works very much like the previous validator but allows to specify a range:
``
requires = IS_DATETIME_IN_RANGE(format=T('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'),
                       minimum=datetime.datetime(2008, 1, 1, 10, 30),
                       maximum=datetime.datetime(2009, 12, 31, 11, 45),
                       error_message='must be YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM::SS!')
``:code

For the full description on % directives look under the IS_DATETIME validator.

#### Range, set and equality validators

##### ``IS_EQUAL_TO``
``IS_EQUAL_TO``:inxx

Checks whether the validated value is equal to a given value (which can be a variable):
``
requires = IS_EQUAL_TO(request.vars.password,
                       error_message='passwords do not match')
``:code

##### ``IS_NOT_EMPTY``
``IS_NOT_EMPTY``:inxx

This validator checks that the content of the field value is neither None nor an empty string nor an empty list. A string value is checked for after a ``.strip()``.
``
requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY(error_message='cannot be empty!')
``:code

You can provide a regular expression for the matching of the empty string.
``
requires = IS_NOT_EMPTY(error_message='Enter a value', empty_regex='NULL(?i)')
``:code

##### ``IS_NULL_OR``
``IS_NULL_OR``:inxx

Deprecated, an alias for ``IS_EMPTY_OR`` described below.

##### ``IS_EMPTY_OR``
``IS_EMPTY_OR``:inxx

Sometimes you need to allow empty values on a field along with other requirements. For example a field may be a date but it can also be empty.
The ``IS_EMPTY_OR`` validator allows this:
``
requires = IS_EMPTY_OR(IS_DATE())
``:code

An empty value is either None or an empty string or an empty list. A string value is checked for after a ``.strip()``.

You can provide a regular expression for the matching of the empty string with the ``empty_regex`` argument (like for IS_NOT_EMPTY validator).

You may also specify a value to be used for the empty case.
``
requires = IS_EMPTY_OR(IS_ALPHANUMERIC(), null='anonymous')
``:code

##### ``IS_EXPR``
``IS_EXPR``:inxx

This validator let you express a general condition by means of a callable which takes a value to validate and returns the error message or ``None`` to accept the input value.
``
requires = IS_EXPR(lambda v: T('not divisible by 3') if int(v) % 3 else None)
``:code
-------
Notice that returned message will not be translated if you do not arrange otherwise.
-------

For backward compatibility the condition may be expressed as a string containing a logical expression in terms of a variable value. It validates a field value if the expression evaluates to ``True``.
``
requires = IS_EXPR('int(value) % 3 == 0',
                   error_message='not divisible by 3')
``:code

One should first check that the value is an integer so that an exception will not occur.
``
requires = [IS_INT_IN_RANGE(0, None),
            IS_EXPR(lambda v: T('not divisible by 3') if v % 3 else None)]
``:code


##### ``IS_DECIMAL_IN_RANGE``
``IS_DECIMAL_IN_RANGE``:inxx

``
INPUT(_type='text', _name='name', requires=IS_DECIMAL_IN_RANGE(0, 10, dot="."))
``:code

It converts the input into a Python Decimal or generates an error if
the decimal does not fall within the specified inclusive range.
The comparison is made with Python Decimal arithmetic.

The minimum and maximum limits can be None, meaning no lower or upper limit,
respectively.

The ``dot`` argument is optional and allows you to internationalize the symbol used to separate the decimals.

##### ``IS_FLOAT_IN_RANGE``
``IS_FLOAT_IN_RANGE``:inxx

Checks that the field value is a floating point number within a definite range, ``0 <= value <= 100`` in the following example:
``
requires = IS_FLOAT_IN_RANGE(0, 100, dot=".",
                             error_message='negative or too large!')
``:code

The ``dot`` argument is optional and allows you to internationalize the symbol used to separate the decimals.

##### ``IS_INT_IN_RANGE``
``IS_INT_IN_RANGE``:inxx

Checks that the field value is an integer number within a definite range,
 ``0 <= value < 100`` in the following example:

``
requires = IS_INT_IN_RANGE(0, 100,
                           error_message='negative or too large!')

##### ``IS_IN_SET``
``IS_IN_SET``:inxx
``multiple``:inxx

In SQLFORM (and the grids) this validator will automatically set the form field to an option field (ie, with a drop-down menu).

``IS_IN_SET`` checks that the field values are in a set:
``
requires = IS_IN_SET(['a', 'b', 'c'], zero=T('choose one'),
                     error_message='must be a or b or c')
``:code

The zero argument is optional and it determines the text of the option selected by default, an option which is not accepted by the ``IS_IN_SET`` validator itself. If you do not want a "choose one" option, set ``zero=None``.

The elements of the set can be combined with a numerical validator, as long as IS_IN_SET is first in the list. Doing so wil force conversion by the last validator to the numerical type. So, IS_IN_SET can be followed by ``IS_INT_IN_RANGE`` (which converts the value to int) or ``IS_FLOAT_IN_RANGE`` (which converts the value to float). For example:
``
requires = [ IS_IN_SET([2, 3, 5, 7], error_message='must be prime and less than 10'),
             IS_INT_IN_RANGE(0, None) ]
``:code

[[checkbox_validation]]
###### Checkbox validation
To force a filled-in form checkbox (such as an acceptance of terms and conditions), use this:
``
requires=IS_IN_SET(['on'])
``:code
###### Dictionaries and tuples with IS_IN_SET
You may also use a dictionary or a list of tuples to make the drop down list more descriptive:
``
Dictionary example:
requires = IS_IN_SET({'A':'Apple', 'B':'Banana', 'C':'Cherry'}, zero=None)

List of tuples example:
requires = IS_IN_SET([('A', 'Apple'), ('B', 'Banana'), ('C', 'Cherry')])
``:code

###### Sorted options
To keep the options alphabetically sorted by their labels into the drop down list, use the ``sort`` argument with IS_IN_SET.
``
IS_IN_SET([('H', 'Hulk'), ('S', 'Superman'), ('B', 'Batman')], sort=True)
``:code

##### ``IS_IN_SET`` and Tagging

The ``IS_IN_SET`` validator has an optional attribute ``multiple=False``. If set to True, multiple values can be stored in one field. The field should be of type ``list:integer`` or ``list:string`` as discussed in [[Chapter 6 ../06#list-type-and-contains]]. An explicit example of tagging is discussed there. We strongly suggest using the jQuery multiselect plugin to render multiple fields.

------
Note that when ``multiple=True``, ``IS_IN_SET`` will accept zero or more values, i.e. it will accept the field when nothing has been selected. ``multiple`` can also be a tuple of the form ``(a, b)`` where ``a`` and ``b`` are the minimum and (exclusive) maximum number of items that can be selected respectively.
------


#### Complexity and security validators
##### ``IS_STRONG``
``IS_STRONG``:inxx

Enforces complexity requirements on a field (usually a password field).

Example:
``
requires = IS_STRONG(min=10, special=2, upper=2)
``:code

where:
- ``min`` is minimum length of the value
- ``special`` is the minimum number of required special characters, by default special characters are any of the following ``~!!@#$%^&*()_+-=?<>,.:;{}[]|`` (you can customize these using ``specials = '...'``)
- ``upper`` is the minimum number of upper case characters
other accepected arguments are:
- ``invalid`` for the list of forbidden characters, by default ``invalid=' "'``
- ``max`` for the maximum length of the value
- ``lower`` for the minimum number of lower case characters
- ``number`` for the minimum number of digit characters

Obviously you can provide an ``error_message`` as for any other validator, although IS_STRONG is clever enough to provide a clear message to describe the validation failure.

A special argument you can use is ``entropy``, that is a minimum value for the complexity of the value to accept (a number), experiment this with:
``
>>> IS_STRONG(entropy=100.0)('hello')
('hello', Entropy (24.53) less than required (100.0))
``:code
-------
Notice that if the argument ``entropy`` is not given then IS_STRONG implicitly sets the following defaults: ``min = 8, upper = 1, lower = 1, number = 1, special = 1`` which otherwise are all sets to ``None``.
-------

##### ``CRYPT``
``CRYPT``:inxx

This is also a filter. It performs a secure hash on the input and it is used to prevent passwords from being passed in the clear to the database.
``
requires = CRYPT()
``:code

By default, CRYPT uses 1000 iterations of the pbkdf2 algorithm combined with SHA512 to produce a 20-byte-long hash. Older versions of web2py used md5 or HMAC+SHA512 depending on whether a key was specified or not.

If a key is specified, CRYPT uses the HMAC algorithm. The key may contain a prefix that determines the algorithm to use with HMAC, for example SHA512:

``
requires = CRYPT(key='sha512:thisisthekey')
``:code

This is the recommended syntax. The key must be a unique string associated with the database used. The key can never be changed. If you lose the key, the previously hashed values become useless.

By default, CRYPT uses random salt, such that each result is different. To use a constant salt value, specify its value:

``
requires = CRYPT(salt='mysaltvalue')
``:code

Or, to use no salt:

``
requires = CRYPT(salt=False)
``:code

The CRYPT validator hashes its input, and this makes it somewhat special. If you need to validate a password field before it is hashed, you can use CRYPT in a list of validators, but must make sure it is the last of the list, so that it is called last. For example:

``
requires = [IS_STRONG(), CRYPT(key='sha512:thisisthekey')]
``:code

``CRYPT`` also takes a ``min_length`` argument, which defaults to zero.

The resulting hash takes the form ``alg$salt$hash``, where ``alg`` is the hash algorithm used, ``salt`` is the salt string (which can be empty), and ``hash`` is the algorithm's output. Consequently, the hash is self-identifying, allowing, for example, the algorithm to be changed without invalidating previous hashes. The key, however, must remain the same.


#### Special type validators

##### ``IS_LIST_OF``
``IS_LIST_OF``:inxx

This validator helps you to ensure length limits on values of type list, for this purpose use its ``minimum``, ``maximum``, and ``error_message`` arguments, for example:
``
requires = IS_LIST_OF(minimum=2)
``:code

A list value may comes from a form containing multiple fields with the same name or a multiple selection box.
Note that this validator automatically converts a non-list value into a single valued list:
``
>>> IS_LIST_OF()('hello')
(['hello'], None)
``:code

If the first argument of IS_LIST_OF is another validator, then it applies the other validator to each element of the list.
A typical usage is validation of a ``list:`` type field, for example:
``
Field('emails', 'list:string', requires=IS_LIST_OF(IS_EMAIL()), ...)
``:code

##### ``IS_LIST_OF_EMAILS``
``IS_LIST_OF_EMAILS``:inxx

This validator is specifically designed to work with the following field:
``
Field('emails', 'list:string',
      widget=SQLFORM.widgets.text.widget,
      requires=IS_LIST_OF_EMAILS(),
      filter_in=lambda l: \\
          IS_LIST_OF_EMAILS.split_emails.findall(l[0]) if l else l,
      represent=lambda v, r: \\
          XML(', '.join([A(x, _href='mailto:'+x).xml() for x in (v or [])]))
     )
``:code
Notice that due to the ``widget`` customization this field will be rendered by a textarea in SQLFORMs (see next [[Widgets #Widgets]] section).
This let you insert and edit multiple emails in a single input field (very much like normal mail client programs do), separating each email address with ``,``, ``;``, and blanks (space, newline, and tab characters).
As a conseguence now we need a validator which is able to operate on a single value input and a way to split the validated value into a list to be next processed by DAL, these are what the ``requires`` and ``filter_in`` arguments stand for.
As alternative to ``filter_in``, you can pass the following function to the ``onvalidation`` argument of form ``accepts``, ``process``, or ``validate`` method (see [[onvalidation #onvalidation]] section):
``
def emails_onvalidation(form):
    form.vars.emails = IS_LIST_OF_EMAILS.split_emails.findall(form.vars.emails)
``:code

The effect of the ``represent`` argument (at lines 6 and 7) is to add a "mailto:..." link to each email address when the record is rendered in HTML pages.

##### ``ANY_OF``
``ANY_OF``:inxx

This validator takes a list of validators and accepts a value if any of the validators in the list does (i.e. it acts like a logical OR with respect to given validators).
``
requires = ANY_OF([IS_ALPHANUMERIC(), IS_EMAIL()])
``:code

When none of the validators accepts the value you get the error message form the last attempted one (the last in the list), you can customize the error message as usual:
``
>>> ANY_OF([IS_ALPHANUMERIC(), IS_EMAIL()])('@ab.co')
('@ab.co', 'Enter a valid email address')
>>> ANY_OF([IS_ALPHANUMERIC(), IS_EMAIL()],
...        error_message='Enter login or email')('@ab.co')
('@ab.co', 'Enter login or email')
``:code

##### ``IS_IMAGE``
``IS_IMAGE``:inxx

This validator checks if a file uploaded through the file input was saved in one of the selected image formats and has dimensions (width and height) within given limits.

It does not check for maximum file size (use IS_LENGTH for that). It returns
a validation failure if no data was uploaded. It supports the file formats BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, and it does not require the Python Imaging Library.

Code parts taken from ref.``source1``:cite

It takes the following arguments:
- extensions: iterable containing allowed image file extensions in lowercase
- maxsize: iterable containing maximum width and height of the image
- minsize: iterable containing minimum width and height of the image

Use (-1, -1) as minsize to bypass the image-size check.

Here are some Examples:
- Check if uploaded file is in any of supported image formats:
``
requires = IS_IMAGE()
``:code
- Check if uploaded file is either JPEG or PNG:
``
requires = IS_IMAGE(extensions=('jpeg', 'png'))
``:code

- Check if uploaded file is PNG with maximum size of 200x200 pixels:
``
requires = IS_IMAGE(extensions=('png'), maxsize=(200, 200))
``:code

- Note: on displaying an edit form for a table including ``requires = IS_IMAGE()``, a ``delete`` checkbox will NOT appear because to delete the file would cause the validation to fail. To display the ``delete`` checkbox use this validation:
``
requires = IS_EMPTY_OR(IS_IMAGE())
``:code

##### ``IS_FILE``
``IS_FILE``:inxx

Checks if name and extension of file uploaded through file input matches given criteria.

Does *not* ensure the file type in any way. Returns validation failure if no data was uploaded.

Its arguments are:
- filename: string/compiled regex or a list of strings/regex of valid filenames
- extension: string/compiled regex or a list of strings/regex of valid extensions
- lastdot: which dot should be used as a filename / extension separator: ``True`` indicates last dot (e.g., "file.tar.gz" will be broken in "file.tar" + "gz") while ``False`` means first dot (e.g., "file.tar.gz" will be broken into "file" + "tar.gz").
- case: 0 means keep the case; 1 means transform the string into lowercase (default); 2 means transform the string into uppercase.

If there is no dot present, extension checks will be done against empty
string and filename checks against whole value.

Examples:
Check if file has a pdf extension (case insensitive):

``
INPUT(_type='file', _name='name',
        requires=IS_FILE(extension='pdf'))
``:code

Check if file is called 'thumbnail' and has a jpg or png extension
(case insensitive):

``
INPUT(_type='file', _name='name',
        requires=IS_FILE(filename='thumbnail',
        extension=['jpg', 'png']))
``:code

Check if file has a tar.gz extension and name starting with backup:

``
INPUT(_type='file', _name='name',
        requires=IS_FILE(filename=re.compile('backup.*'),
        extension='tar.gz', lastdot=False))
``:code

Check if file has no extension and name matching README
(case sensitive):

``
    INPUT(_type='file', _name='name',
        requires=IS_FILE(filename='README',
        extension='', case=0)
``:code

##### ``IS_UPLOAD_FILENAME``
``IS_UPLOAD_FILENAME``:inxx

This is the older implementation for checking files, included for backwards compatibility.  For new applications, use ``IS_FILE()``.

This validator checks if the name and extension of a file uploaded through the file input matches the given criteria.

It does not ensure the file type in any way. Returns validation failure
if no data was uploaded.

Its arguments are:
- filename: filename (before dot) regex.
- extension: extension (after dot) regex.
- lastdot: which dot should be used as a filename / extension separator: ``True`` indicates last dot (e.g., "file.tar.gz" will be broken in "file.tar" + "gz") while ``False`` means first dot (e.g., "file.tar.gz" will be broken into "file" + "tar.gz").
- case: 0 means keep the case; 1 means transform the string into lowercase (default); 2 means transform the string into uppercase.

If there is no dot present, extension checks will be done against an empty
string and filename checks will be done against the whole value.

Examples:

Check if file has a pdf extension (case insensitive):
``
requires = IS_UPLOAD_FILENAME(extension='pdf')
``:code

Check if file has a tar.gz extension and name starting with backup:
``
requires = IS_UPLOAD_FILENAME(filename='backup.*', extension='tar.gz', lastdot=False)
``:code

Check if file has no extension and name matching README (case sensitive):
``
requires = IS_UPLOAD_FILENAME(filename='^README$', extension='^$', case=0)
``:code

##### ``IS_IPV4``
``IS_IPV4``:inxx

This validator checks if a field's value is an IP version 4 address in decimal form. Can
be set to force addresses from a certain range.

IPv4 regex taken from ref.``regexlib``:cite

The signature for the ``IS_IPV4`` constructor is the following:
``
IS_IPV4(minip='0.0.0.0', maxip='255.255.255.255', invert=False,
        is_localhost=None, is_private=None, is_automatic=None,
        error_message='Enter valid IPv4 address')
``:code
Where:
- ``minip`` is the lowest allowed address
- ``maxip`` is the highest allowed address
- ``invert`` is a flag to invert allowed address range, i.e. if set to True allows addresses only from outside of given range; note that range boundaries are not matched this way

You can pass an IP address either as a string (e.g. '192.168.0.1') or as a list or tuple of 4 integers (e.g. [192, 168, 0, 1]).

To check for multiple address ranges pass to ``minip`` and ``maxip`` a list or tuple of boundary addresses, for example to allow only addresses between '192.168.20.10' and '192.168.20.19' or between '192.168.30.100' and '192.168.30.199' use:
``
requires = IS_IPV4(minip=('192.168.20.10', '192.168.30.100'),
                   maxip=('192.168.20.19', '192.168.30.199'))
``:code
-------
Notice that only a range for which both lower and upper limits are set is configured, that is the number of configured ranges is determined by the shorter of the iterables passed to ``minip`` and ``maxip``.
-------

The arguments ``is_localhost``, ``is_private``, and ``is_automatic`` accept the following values:
- ``None`` to ignore the option
- ``True`` to force the option
- ``False`` to forbid the option

The option meanings are:
- ``is_localhost``: match localhost address (127.0.0.1)
- ``is_private``: match address in 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 and 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 ranges
- ``is_automatic``: match address in 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255 range

Examples:

Check for valid IPv4 address:
``
requires = IS_IPV4()
``:code

Check for valid private network IPv4 address:
``
requires = IS_IPV4(minip='192.168.0.1', maxip='192.168.255.255')
``:code

##### ``IS_IPV6``
``IS_IPV6``:inxx

This validator checks if a field's value is an IP version 6 address.

The signature for the ``IS_IPV6`` constructor is the following:
``
IS_IPV6(is_private=None,
        is_link_local=None,
        is_reserved=None,
        is_multicast=None,
        is_routeable=None,
        is_6to4=None,
        is_teredo=None,
        subnets=None,
        error_message='Enter valid IPv6 address')
``:code

The arguments ``is_private``, ``is_link_local``, ``is_reserved``, ``is_multicast``, ``is_routeable``, ``is_6to4``, and ``is_teredo`` accept the following values:
- ``None`` to ignore the option
- ``True`` to force the option
- ``False`` to forbid the option, this does not work for ``is_routeable``

The option meanings are:
- ``is_private``: match an address allocated for private networks
- ``is_link_local``: match an address reserved for link-local (i.e. in fe80::/10 range), this is a private network too (also matched by ``is_private`` above)
- ``is_reserved``: match an address otherwise IETF reserved
- ``is_multicast``: match an address reserved for multicast use (i.e. in ff00::/8 range)
- ``is_6to4``: match an address that appear to contain a 6to4 embedded address (i.e. in 2002::/16 range)
- ``is_teredo``: match a teredo address (i.e. in 2001::/32 range)

Forcing ``is_routeable`` (setting to True) is a shortcut to forbid (setting to False) ``is_private``, ``is_reserved``, and ``is_multicast`` all.

Use the ``subnets`` argument to pass a subnet or list of subnets to check for address membership, this way an address must be a subnet member to validate.

Examples:

Check for valid IPv6 address:
``
requires = IS_IPV6()
``:code

Check for valid private network IPv6 address:
``
requires = IS_IPV6(is_link_local=True)
``:code

Check for valid IPv6 address in subnet:
``
requires = IS_IPV6(subnets='fb00::/8')
``:code

##### ``IS_IPADDRESS``
``IS_IPADDRESS``:inxx

This validator checks if a field's value is an IP address (either version 4 or version 6).
Can be set to force addresses from within a specific range.
Checks are done using the appropriate ``IS_IPV4`` or ``IS_IPV6`` validator.

The signature for the ``IS_IPADDRESS`` constructor is the following:
``
IS_IPADDRESS(minip='0.0.0.0', maxip='255.255.255.255', invert=False,
             is_localhost=None, is_private=None, is_automatic=None,
             is_ipv4=None,
             is_link_local=None, is_reserved=None, is_multicast=None,
             is_routeable=None, is_6to4=None, is_teredo=None,
             subnets=None, is_ipv6=None,
             error_message='Enter valid IP address')
``:code

With respect to ``IS_IPV4`` and ``IS_IPV6`` validators the only added arguments are:
- ``is_ipv4``, set to True to force version 4 or set to False to forbid version 4
- ``is_ipv6``, set to True to force version 6 or set to False to forbid version 6

Refer to [[IS_IPV4 #IS_IPV4]] and [[IS_IPV6 #IS_IPV6]] validators for the meaning of other arguments.

Examples:

Check for valid IP address (both IPv4 and IPv6):
``
requires = IS_IPADDRESS()
``:code

Check for valid IP address (IPv6 only):
``
requires = IS_IPADDRESS(is_ipv6=True)
``:code

#### Other validators
##### ``CLEANUP``
``CLEANUP``:inxx

This is a filter. It never fails. By default it just removes all characters whose decimal ASCII codes are not in the list [10, 13, 32-127]. It always perform an initial strip (i.e. heading and trailing blank characters removal) on the value.
``
requires = CLEANUP()
``:code

You can pass a regular expression to decide what has to be removed, for example to clear all non-digit characters use:
``
>>> CLEANUP('[^\\d]')('Hello 123 world 456')
('123456', None)
``:code

#### Database validators

##### ``IS_NOT_IN_DB``
``IS_NOT_IN_DB``:inxx
######Synopsis:
``IS_NOT_IN_DB(db|set, 'table.field')``

Consider the following example:
``
db.define_table('person', Field('name'))
db.person.name.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, 'person.name')
``:code

It requires that when you insert a new person, his/her name is not already in the database, ``db``, in the field ``person.name``. 

A set can be used instead of ``db``.

As with all other validators this requirement is enforced at the form processing level, not at the database level. This means that there is a small probability that, if two visitors try to concurrently insert records with the same person.name, this results in a race condition and both records are accepted. It is therefore safer to also inform the database that this field should have a unique value:
``
db.define_table('person', Field('name', unique=True))
db.person.name.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(db, 'person.name')
``:code

Now if a race condition occurs, the database raises an OperationalError and one of the two inserts is rejected.

The first argument of ``IS_NOT_IN_DB`` can be a database connection or a Set. In the latter case, you would be checking only the set defined by the Set.

A complete argument list for ``IS_NOT_IN_DB()`` is as follows:
``
IS_NOT_IN_DB(dbset, field, error_message='value already in database or empty',
             allowed_override=[], ignore_common_filters=True)
``:code

The following code, for example, does not allow registration of two persons with the same name within 10 days of each other:
``
import datetime
now = datetime.datetime.today()
db.define_table('person',
    Field('name'),
    Field('registration_stamp', 'datetime', default=now))
recent = db(db.person.registration_stamp > now-datetime.timedelta(10))
db.person.name.requires = IS_NOT_IN_DB(recent, 'person.name')
``:code

##### ``IS_IN_DB``
``IS_IN_DB``:inxx
[[validate_IS_IN_DB]]
######Synopsis:
``IS_IN_DB(db|set, 'table.value_field', '%(representing_field)s', zero='choose one')``
where the third and fourth arguments are optional.

``multiple=`` is also possible if the field type is a list. The default is False. It can be set to True or to a tuple (min, max) to restrict the number of values selected. So ``multiple=(1, 10)`` enforces at least one and at most nine selections.

Other optional arguments are discussed below.

######Example
Consider the following tables and requirement:

``
db.define_table('person', Field('name', unique=True))
db.define_table('dog', Field('name'), Field('owner', db.person))
db.dog.owner.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, 'person.id', '%(name)s',
                                 zero=T('choose one'))
``:code
the IS_IN_DB requirement could also be written to use a Set instead of db
``
db.dog.owner.requires = IS_IN_DB(db(db.person.id > 10), 'person.id', '%(name)s',
                                 zero=T('choose one'))
``:code

It is enforced at the level of dog INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE forms. This example requires that a ``dog.owner`` be a valid id in the field ``person.id`` in the database ``db``. Because of this validator, the ``dog.owner`` field is represented as a drop-down list.
The third argument of the validator is a string that describes the elements in the drop-down list, this is passed to the ``label`` argument of the validator. In the example you want to see the person ``%(name)s`` instead of the person ``%(id)s``. ``%(...)s`` is replaced by the value of the field in brackets for each record. Other accepted values for the ``label`` are a Field instance (e.g. you could use db.person.name instead of '%(name)s') or even a callable that takes a row and returns the description for the option.

The ``zero`` option works very much like for the ``IS_IN_SET`` validator.

Other optional arguments accepted by ``IS_IN_DB`` are: ``orderby``, ``groupby``, ``distinct``, ``cache``, and ``left``, these are passed to the db select (see on [[Chapter 6 ../06##orderby-groupby-limitby-distinct-having-orderby_on_limitby-left-cache]] for their meanings).
-------
Notice that ``groupby``, ``distinct``, and ``left`` do not apply to Google App Engine.
-------

To alphabetically sort the options listed in the drop-down list you can set the ``sort`` argument to ``True`` (sorting is case-insensitive), this may be usefull when no ``orderby`` is feasible or practical.

The first argument of the validator can be a database connection or a DAL Set, as in ``IS_NOT_IN_DB``. This can be useful for example when wishing to limit the records in the drop-down list. In this example, we use ``IS_IN_DB`` in a controller to limit the records dynamically each time the controller is called:

``
def index():
    (...)
    query = (db.table.field == 'xyz') # in practice 'xyz' would be a variable
    db.table.field.requires = IS_IN_DB(db(query), ...)
    form = SQLFORM(...)
    if form.process().accepted: ...
    (...)
``:code

If you want the field validated, but you do not want a drop-down, you must put the validator in a list.

``
db.dog.owner.requires = [IS_IN_DB(db, 'person.id', '%(name)s')]
``:code

``_and``:inxx
Occasionally you want the drop-down (so you do not want to use the list syntax above) yet you want to use additional validators. For this purpose the ``IS_IN_DB`` validator takes an extra argument ``_and`` that can point to a list of other validators applied if the validated value passes the ``IS_IN_DB`` validation. For example to validate all dog owners in db that are not in a subset:
``
subset = db(db.person.id > 100)
db.dog.owner.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, 'person.id', '%(name)s',
                                 _and=IS_NOT_IN_DB(subset, 'person.id'))
``:code


##### ``IS_IN_DB`` and Tagging
``tags``:inxx
``multiple``:inxx

The ``IS_IN_DB`` validator has an optional attribute ``multiple=False``. If set to ``True`` multiple values can be stored in one field. This field should be of type ``list:reference`` as discussed in [[Chapter 6 ../06#list-type-and-contains]]. An explicit example of tagging is discussed there. Multiple references are handled automatically in create and update forms, but they are transparent to the DAL. We strongly suggest using the jQuery multiselect plugin to render multiple fields.

#### Custom validators
``custom validator``:inxx

All validators follow the prototype below:
``
class sample_validator:
    def __init__(self, *a, error_message='error'):
        self.a = a
        self.e = error_message
    def __call__(self, value):
        if validate(value):
            return (parsed(value), None)
        return (value, self.e)
    def formatter(self, value):
        return format(value)
``:code

i.e., when called to validate a value, a validator returns a tuple ``(x, y)``. If ``y`` is ``None``, then the value passed validation and ``x`` contains a parsed value. For example, if the validator requires the value to be an integer, ``x`` is converted to ``int(value)``. If the value did not pass validation, then ``x`` contains the input value and ``y`` contains an error message that explains the failed validation. This error message is used to report the error in forms that do not validate.

------
Notice that as alternative to custom validators, you can also use the ``onvalidation`` argument of form ``accepts``, ``process``, and ``validate`` methods (see [[onvalidation #onvalidation]] section).
------

The validator may also contain a ``formatter`` method. It must perform the opposite conversion to the one the ``__call__`` does. For example, consider the source code for ``IS_DATE``:
``
class IS_DATE(object):
    def __init__(self, format='%Y-%m-%d', error_message='must be YYYY-MM-DD!'):
        self.format = format
        self.error_message = error_message
    def __call__(self, value):
        try:
            y, m, d, hh, mm, ss, t0, t1, t2 = time.strptime(value, str(self.format))
            value = datetime.date(y, m, d)
            return (value, None)
        except:
            return (value, self.error_message)
    def formatter(self, value):
        return value.strftime(str(self.format))
``:code

On success, the ``__call__`` method reads a date string from the form and converts it into a datetime.date object using the format string specified in the constructor. The ``formatter`` method takes a datetime.date object and converts it to a string representation using the same format. The ``formatter`` is called automatically in forms, but you can also call it explicitly to convert objects into their proper representation. For example:
``
>>> db = DAL()
>>> db.define_table('atable',
       Field('birth', 'date', requires=IS_DATE('%m/%d/%Y')))
>>> id = db.atable.insert(birth=datetime.date(2008, 1, 1))
>>> row = db.atable[id]
>>> print db.atable.birth.formatter(row.birth)
01/01/2008
``:code

#### Multiple Validators

Normally, when multiple validators are required (and stored in a list), they are executed in order and the output of one is passed as input to the next. The chain breaks when one of the validators fails.

Conversely, when we call the ``formatter`` method of a field, the formatters of the associated validators are also chained, but in reverse order.

As an alternative to the chained behavior described above, the ``ANY_OF`` validator can be used to combine a list of validators, and to pass if **any** of the validators pass (see the [[ANY_OF #ANY_OF]] section for details).


#### Validators with dependencies

Usually validators are set once for all in models.

Occasionally, you need to validate a field and the validator depends on the value of another field. This can be done in various ways. It can be done in the model or in the controller.

For example, here is a page that generates a registration form that asks for username and password twice. None of the fields can be empty, and both passwords must match:
``
def index():
    form = SQLFORM.factory(
        Field('username', requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
        Field('password', requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY()),
        Field('password_again',
              requires=IS_EQUAL_TO(request.vars.password)))
    if form.process().accepted:
        pass # or take some action
    return dict(form=form)
``:code

### Widgets

Here is a list of available web2py widgets:
``
SQLFORM.widgets.string.widget
SQLFORM.widgets.text.widget
SQLFORM.widgets.password.widget
SQLFORM.widgets.integer.widget
SQLFORM.widgets.double.widget
SQLFORM.widgets.time.widget
SQLFORM.widgets.date.widget
SQLFORM.widgets.datetime.widget
SQLFORM.widgets.upload.widget
SQLFORM.widgets.boolean.widget
SQLFORM.widgets.options.widget
SQLFORM.widgets.multiple.widget
SQLFORM.widgets.radio.widget
SQLFORM.widgets.checkboxes.widget
SQLFORM.widgets.autocomplete
SQLFORM.widgets.list
``:code

The first ten of them plus "list" are the defaults for the corresponding field types. The "options" widget is used when a field's requires is ``IS_IN_SET`` or ``IS_IN_DB`` with ``multiple=False`` (default behavior). The "multiple" widget is used when a field's requires is ``IS_IN_SET`` or ``IS_IN_DB`` with ``multiple=True``. The "radio" and "checkboxes" widgets are never used by default, but can be set manually. The "autocomplete" widget is special and discussed in its own section.

For example, to have a "string" field represented by a textarea:
``
Field('comment', 'string', widget=SQLFORM.widgets.text.widget)
``:code

Widgets can also be assigned to fields ''a posteriori'':

``
db.mytable.myfield.widget = SQLFORM.widgets.string.widget
``:code

Sometimes widgets take additional arguments and one needs to specify their values. In this case one can use ``lambda``

``
db.mytable.myfield.widget = lambda field, value: \\
    SQLFORM.widgets.string.widget(field, value, _style='color:blue')
``:code

Widgets are helper factories and their first two arguments are always ``field`` and ``value``. The other arguments can include normal helper attributes such as ``_style``, ``_class``, etc. Some widgets also take special arguments. In particular ``SQLFORM.widgets.radio`` and ``SQLFORM.widgets.checkboxes`` take a ``style`` argument (not to be confused with ``_style``) which can be set to "table", "ul", "divs" or whatever matches the ``formstyle`` of the containing form.

You can create new widgets or extend existing widgets.

``SQLFORM.widgets[type]`` is a class and ``SQLFORM.widgets[type].widget`` is a static member function of the corresponding class. Each widget function takes two arguments: the field object, and the current value of that field. It returns a representation of the widget. As an example, the string widget could be re-coded as follows:
``
def my_string_widget(field, value):
    return INPUT(_name=field.name,
                 _id="%s_%s" % (field.tablename, field.name),
                 _class=field.type,
                 _value=value,
                 requires=field.requires)

Field('comment', 'string', widget=my_string_widget)
``:code

The id and class values must follow the convention described later in this chapter. A widget may contain its own validators, but it is good practice to associate the validators to the "requires" attribute of the field and have the widget get them from there.

#### Autocomplete widget
``autocomplete``:inxx

There are two possible uses for the autocomplete widget: to autocomplete a field that takes a value from a list or to autocomplete a reference field (where the string to be autocompleted is a representation of the reference which is implemented as an id).

The first case is easy:
``
db.define_table('category', Field('name'))
db.define_table('product', Field('name'), Field('category'))
db.product.category.widget = SQLFORM.widgets.autocomplete(
     request, db.category.name, limitby=(0, 10), min_length=2)
``:code

Where ``limitby`` instructs the widget to display no more than 10 suggestions at the time, and ``min_length`` instructs the widget to perform an Ajax callback to fetch suggestions only after the user has typed at least 2 characters in the search box.
When used this way you can avoid duplicate suggestions setting optional argument ``distinct=True``.
-------
Notice that both arguments ``limitby=(0, 10)`` and ``min_length=2`` could be omitted in the example above because of their default values.

Notice that ``distinct`` does not work when autocompleting a virtual field (see [[Chapter 6 ../06#New-style-virtual-fields]] for virtual fields).
-------

The second case is more complex:
``
db.define_table('category', Field('name'))
db.define_table('product', Field('name'), Field('category', 'reference category'))
db.product.category.widget = SQLFORM.widgets.autocomplete(
     request, db.category.name, id_field=db.category.id)
``:code

In this case the value of ``id_field`` tells the widget that even if the value to be autocompleted is a ``db.category.name``, the value to be stored is the corresponding ``db.category.id``.
An optional parameter is ``orderby`` that instructs the widget on how to sort the suggestions, for example to have them alphabetically sorted use:
``
db.product.category.widget = SQLFORM.widgets.autocomplete(
     request, db.category.name, id_field=db.category.id,
     orderby=db.category.name)
``:code

You cannot use ``distinct=True`` to avoid duplicate suggestions in this case, because when autocompleting a reference field the id_field is selected too (see [[Chapter 6 ../06#distinct]] for further details).

When looking for suggestion the widget normally matches at beginning of the field value, to let the widget matching everywhere (i.e. performing a search) set optional argument ``at_beginning=False``.
-------
Note that on Google App Engine both ``distinct=True`` and ``at_beginning=False`` do not work.
-------

This widget works via Ajax. Where is the Ajax callback? Some magic is going on in this widget. The callback is a method of the widget object itself. How is it exposed? In web2py any piece of code can generate a response by raising an HTTP exception. This widget exploits this possibility in the following way: the widget sends the Ajax call to the same URL that generated the widget in the first place and puts a special token in the request.vars. Should the widget get instantiated again, it finds the token and raises an HTTP exception that responds to the request. All of this is done under the hood and hidden to the developer.

To enahnce security, the autocomplete widget can digitally sign Ajax callbacks, this is done through the ``user_signature`` and ``hash_vars`` arguments, see on [[Chapter 4 ../04#Digitally-signed-urls]] for an explanation of that.

### ``SQLFORM.grid`` and ``SQLFORM.smartgrid``

-------
Attention: grid and smartgrid were experimental prior web2py version 2.0 and were vulnerable to information leakage. The grid and smartgrid are no longer experimental, but we are still not promising backward compatibility of the presentation layer of the grid, only of its APIs.
-------

These are two high level objects that create complex CRUD controls. They provide pagination, the ability to browse, search, sort, create, update and delete records from a single object.

Because web2py's HTML objects build on the underlying, simpler objects, the grids create SQLFORMs for viewing, editing and creating its rows. Many of the arguments to the grids are passed through to this SQLFORM. This means the documentation for SQLFORM (and FORM) is relevant. For example, the grid takes an ``onvalidation`` callback. The processing logic of the grid ultimately passes this through to the underlying process() method of FORM, which means you should consult the documentation of ``onvalidation`` for FORMs.

As the grid passes through different states, such as editing a row, a new request is generated. request.args has information about which state the grid is in.


### ``SQLFORM.grid`` 
The simplest of the two is ``SQLFORM.grid``. Here is an example of usage:

``
@auth.requires_login()
def manage_users():
    grid = SQLFORM.grid(db.auth_user)
    return locals()
``:code

which produces the following page:

[[image @///image/en6700.png center 480px]]

The first argument of ``SQLFORM.grid`` can be a table or a query. The grid object will provide access to records matching the query.

Before we dive into the long list of arguments of the grid object we need to understand how it works. The object looks at ``request.args`` in order to decide what to do (browse, search, create, update, delete, etc.). Each button created by the object links the same function (``manage_users`` in the above case) but passes different ``request.args``. 

#### login required by default for data updates
By default all the URLs generated by the grid are digitally signed and verified. This means one cannot perform certain actions (create, update, delete) without being logged-in. These restrictions can be relaxed:

``
def manage_users():
    grid = SQLFORM.grid(db.auth_user, user_signature=False)
    return locals()
``:code

but we do not recommend it.


#### Multiple grids per controller function
-----
Because of the way grid works one can only have one grid per controller function, unless they are embedded as components via ``LOAD``.
To make the default search grid work in more than one LOADed grid, please use a different ``formname`` for each one.
-----

#### Using requests.args safely
Because the controller function that contains the grid may itself manipulate the URL arguments (known in web2py as response.args and response.vars), the grid needs to know which args should be handled by the grid and which not. Here is an example of code that allows one to manage any table:

``
@auth.requires_login()
def manage():
    table = request.args(0)
    if not table in db.tables(): redirect(URL('error'))
    grid = SQLFORM.grid(db[table], args=request.args[:1])
    return locals()
``:code

the ``args`` argument of the ``grid`` specifies which ``request.args`` should be passed along and ignored by the ``grid``. In our case ``request.args[:1]`` is the name of the table we want to manage and it is handled by the ``manage`` function itself, not by the ``grid``. So, ``args=request.args[:1]`` tells the grid to preserve the first URL argument in any links that it generates, appending any grid-specific arguments after that first argument.

#### SQLFORM.grid signature
The complete signature for the grid is the following:

``
SQLFORM.grid(
    query,
    fields=None,
    field_id=None,
    left=None,
    headers={},
    orderby=None,
    groupby=None,
    searchable=True,
    sortable=True,
    paginate=20,
    deletable=True,
    editable=True,
    details=True,
    selectable=None,
    create=True,
    csv=True,
    links=None,
    links_in_grid=True,
    upload='<default>',
    args=[],
    user_signature=True,
    maxtextlengths={},
    maxtextlength=20,
    onvalidation=None,
    onfailure=None,
    oncreate=None,
    onupdate=None,
    ondelete=None,
    sorter_icons=(XML('&#x25B2;'), XML('&#x25BC;')),
    ui = 'web2py',
    showbuttontext=True,
    _class="web2py_grid",
    formname='web2py_grid',
    search_widget='default',
    advanced_search=True,
    ignore_rw = False,
    formstyle = None,
    exportclasses = None,
    formargs={},
    createargs={},
    editargs={},
    viewargs={},
    selectable_submit_button='Submit',
    buttons_placement = 'right',
    links_placement = 'right',
    noconfirm=False,
    cache_count=None,
    client_side_delete=False,
    ignore_common_filters=None,
    auto_pagination=True,
    use_cursor=False,
    represent_none=None,
    showblobs=False
    )
``:code

- ``fields`` is a list of fields to be fetched from the database. It is also used to determine which fields to be shown in the grid view. However, it doesn't control what is displayed in the separate form used to edit rows. For that, use the readable and writable attribute of the database fields. For example, in a editable grid, suppress updating of a field like this: before creating the SQLFORM.grid, set 
  ``
db.my_table.a_field.writable = False
db.my_table.a_field.readable = False
``:code
- ``field_id`` must be the field of the table to be used as ID, for example ``db.mytable.id``. This is useful when the grid query is a join of several tables. Any action button on the grid (add record, view, edit, delete) will work over db.mytable. 
- ``left`` is an optional left join expressions used to build ``...select(left=...)``.
- ``headers`` is a dictionary that maps 'tablename.fieldname' into the corresponding header label, e.g. ``{'auth_user.email' : 'Email Address'}``
- ``orderby`` is used as default ordering for the rows. See [[Chapter 6 ../06#orderby]] (multiple fields are possible).
- ``groupby`` is used to group the set. Use the same syntax as you were passing in a simple ``select(groupby=...)``.
- ``searchable``, ``sortable``, ``deletable``, ``editable``, ``details``, ``create`` determine whether one can search, sort, delete, edit, view details, and create new records respectively.
  ``deletable``, ``editable`` and ``details`` are usually boolean values but they can be functions which take the row object and decide whether to display the corresponding button or not.
- ``selectable`` can be used to call a custom function on multiple records (a checkbox will be inserted for every row) e.g.
  ``selectable = lambda ids : redirect(URL('default', 'mapping_multiple', vars=dict(id=ids)))
``:code
  a submit button will be added in the checkboxes column with the label passed in ``selectable_submit_button``;
  or for multiple action buttons, use a list of tuples:
  ``selectable = [('button label1', lambda...), ('button label2', lambda ...)]
``:code
- ``paginate`` sets the max number of rows per page.
- ``csv`` if set to True allows to download the grid in various format (see also ``exportclasses`` below).
- ``links`` is used to display new columns which can be links to other pages. The ``links`` argument must be a list of  ``dict(header='name', body=lambda row: A(...))`` where ``header`` is the header of the new column and ``body`` is a function that takes a row and returns a value. In the example, the value is a ``A(...)`` helper.
- ``links_in_grid`` if set to False, links will only be displayed in the "details" and "edit" page (so, not on the main grid)
- ``upload`` same as SQLFORM's one. web2py uses the action at that URL to download the file
- ``maxtextlength`` sets the maximum length of text to be displayed for each field value, in the grid view. This value can be overwritten for each field using ``maxtextlengths``, a dictionary of 'tablename.fieldname':length e.g. ``{'auth_user.email' : 50}``
- ``onvalidation``, ``onfailure``, ``oncreate``, ``onupdate`` and ``ondelete`` are callback functions. All but ``ondelete`` take a form object as input, ondelete takes the table and the record id.
  Because the edit/create form is an SQLFORM which extends FORM, these callbacks are essentially used in the same way as documented in the sections for FORM and SQLFORM. Here is skeleton code:
  ``
def myonvalidation(form):
    print "In onvalidation callback"
    print form.vars
    form.errors= True  #this prevents the submission from completing
    
    #...or to add messages to specific elements on the form
    form.errors.first_name = "Do not name your child after prominent deities"	
    form.errors.last_name = "Last names must start with a letter"
    response.flash = "I don't like your submission" 

def myonfailure(form):
    print 'edit/create validation problem'
    print form.errors

def myoncreate(form):
    print 'create!'
    print form.vars

def myonupdate(form):
    print 'update!'
    print form.vars

def myondelete(table, id):
    print 'delete!'
    print table, id
``:code
  ``onupdate`` and ``oncreate`` callbacks are passed to ``SQLFORM.process(onsuccess=...)``.

- ``sorter_icons`` is a list of two strings (or helpers) that will be used to represent the up and down sorting options for each field.
- ``ui`` can be set equal to ``'web2py'`` (default) and will generate web2py friendly class names, can be set equal to ``'jquery-ui'`` and will generate jquery UI friendly class names, but it can also be its own set of class names for the various grid components:
  ``
ui = dict(
    widget='',
    header='',
    content='',
    default='',
    cornerall='',
    cornertop='',
    cornerbottom='',
    button='button',
    buttontext='buttontext button',
    buttonadd='icon plus',
    buttonback='icon leftarrow',
    buttonexport='icon downarrow',
    buttondelete='icon trash',
    buttonedit='icon pen',
    buttontable='icon rightarrow',
    buttonview='icon magnifier')
``:code

- ``search_widget`` allows to override the default search widget and we refer the reader the source code in gluon/sqlhtml.py for details.
- ``advanced_search`` if set to False, advanced search capabilities are disabled on search widget
- ``showbuttontext`` allows buttons without text (there will effectively be only icons)
- ``_class`` is the class for the grid container.
- ``exportclasses`` takes a dictionary of tuples: by default it's defined as
  ``
dict(
  csv_with_hidden_cols=(ExporterCSV_hidden, 'CSV (hidden cols)', T(...)),
  csv=(ExporterCSV, 'CSV', T(...)),
  xml=(ExporterXML, 'XML', T('XML export of columns shown')),
  html=(ExporterHTML, 'HTML', T('HTML export of visible columns')),
  json=(ExporterJSON, 'JSON', T('JSON export of visible columns')),
  tsv_with_hidden_cols=
      (ExporterTSV, 'TSV (Spreadsheets, hidden cols)', T(...)),
  tsv=(ExporterTSV, 'TSV (Spreadsheets)', T(...)))
``:code
  ExporterCSV_hidden, ExporterCSV, ExporterXML, ExporterHTML, ExporterJSON and ExporterTSV are all defined in gluon/sqlhtml.py. Take a look at those for creating your own exporter. If you pass a dict like ``dict(xml=False, html=False)`` you will disable the xml and html export formats.

- ``formargs`` is passed to all SQLFORM objects used by the grid, while ``createargs``, ``editargs`` and ``viewargs`` are passed only to the specific create, edit and details SQLFORMs
- ``formname``, ``ignore_rw`` and ``formstyle`` are passed to the SQLFORM objects used by the grid for create/update forms.
- ``buttons_placement`` and ``links_placement`` both take a parameter ('right', 'left', 'both') that will affect where on the row the buttons (or the links) will be placed
- ``noconfirm`` if set to True do not requires user confirmation upon record delete.
- ``cache_count`` is used to speed up the grid rows counting, it works either caching the selecting query (in this case you pass a tuple as for the ``cache`` argument of ``select``, see [[Chapter 6 ../06#Caching-selects]]), or directly providing the number of rows (i.e. an integer or a callable returning the integer count).
- ``client_side_delete`` if set to True requires that the grid gets reloaded on delete on Ajax (i.e. the value of ``client_side_delete`` is passed to ``client_side`` argument of ``redirect``, see also [[Chapter 4 ../04#HTTP-and-redirect]]).
- ``ignore_common_filters`` can be set to True for common filters suppression upon grid db set definition (i.e. while evaluating query). Common filters are described in [[Chapter 6 ../06#Common-filters]].
- ``auto_pagination`` if set to True enforce always an ordering over records to avoid pagination issues.
- ``use_cursor`` is specific to Google NoSQL (Datastore) only, if set to True allows use of cursor for pagination. 
- ``represent_none`` is an optional value to be used instead of None when showing records in grid/details view.
- ``showblobs`` if set to True tell the grid to show fields of ``blob`` type, which by default are not shown.

#### Virtual fields in SQLFORM.grid and smartgrid
In versions of web2py after 2.6, virtual fields are shown in grids like normal fields: either shown alongside all other fields by default, or by including them in the ``fields`` argument. However, virtual fields are not sortable. 

In older web2py versions, showing virtual fields in a grid requires use of the ``links`` argument. This is still supported for more recent versions. If table db.t1 has a field called t1.vfield which is based on the values of t1.field1 and t1.field2, do this:

``grid = SQLFORM.grid(db.t1, ..., fields = [t1.field1, t1.field2, ...],
   links = [dict(header='Virtual Field 1', body=lambda row:row.vfield), ...] )
``:code

In all cases, because t1.vfield depends on t1.field1 and t1.field2, these fields must be present in the row. In the example above, this is guaranteed by including t1.field1 and t1.field2 in the ``fields`` argument. Alternatively, showing all fields will also work. You can suppress a field from displaying by setting the ``readable`` attribute to False. 

Note that when defining the virtual field, the lambda function must qualify fields with the table name, but in the links argument, this is not necessary.
So for the example above, the virtual field may be defined like:
``
db.define_table('t1', Field('field1', 'string'),
   Field('field2', 'string'),
   Field.Virtual('vfield', lambda row: row.t1.field1 + row.t1.field2),
   ...)
``:code

#### SQLFORM.smartgrid

A ``SQLFORM.smartgrid`` looks a lot like a ``grid``, in fact it contains a grid but it is designed to take as input not a query but only one table and to browse said table and selected referencing tables.

For example consider the following table structure:

``
db.define_table('parent', Field('name'))
db.define_table('child', Field('name'), Field('parent', 'reference parent'))
``:code

With SQLFORM.grid you can list all parents:

``
SQLFORM.grid(db.parent)
``:code
all children:
``
SQLFORM.grid(db.child)
``:code
and all parents and children in one table:
``
SQLFORM.grid(db.parent, left=db.child.on(db.child.parent==db.parent.id))
``:code

With SQLFORM.smartgrid you can put all the data in one object that spawns both tables:

``
@auth.requires_login()
def manage():
    grid = SQLFORM.smartgrid(db.parent, linked_tables=['child'])
    return locals()
``:code

which looks like this:

[[image @///image/en6800.png center 480px]]

Notice the extra "children" links. One could create the extra ``links`` using a regular ``grid`` but they would point to a different action. With a ``smartgrid`` they are created automatically and handled by the same object.

Also notice that when clicking on the "children" link for a given parent one only gets the list of children for that parent (and that is obvious) but also notice that if one now tried to add a new child, the parent value for the new child is automatically set to the selected parent (displayed in the breadcrumbs associated to the object). The value of this field can be overwritten. We can prevent this by making it readonly:

``
@auth.requires_login()
def manage():
    db.child.parent.writable = False
    grid = SQLFORM.smartgrid(db.parent, linked_tables=['child'])
    return locals()
``:code

If the ``linked_tables`` argument is not specified all referencing tables are automatically linked. Anyway, to avoid accidentally exposing data we recommend explicitly listing tables that should be linked.

The following code creates a very powerful management interface for all tables in the system:

``
@auth.requires_membership('managers')
def manage():
    table = request.args(0) or 'auth_user'
    if not table in db.tables(): redirect(URL('error'))
    grid = SQLFORM.smartgrid(db[table], args=request.args[:1])
    return locals()
``:code

#### smartgrid signature

The ``smartgrid`` takes the same arguments as a ``grid`` and some more with some caveats:

- The first argument is a table, not a query
- There is an extra argument ``constraints`` which is a dictionary of 'tablename':query which can be used to further restrict access to the records displayed in the 'tablename' grid.
- There is an extra argument ``linked_tables`` which is a list of tablenames of tables that should be accessible via the smartgrid.
- ``divider`` allows to specify a character to use in the breadcrumb navigator, ``breadcrumbs_class`` will apply the class to the breadcrumb element
- All the arguments but the table, ``args``, ``linked_tables``, ``links_in_grid``, and ``user_signature`` can be dictionaries as explained below.

Consider the previous grid:
``
grid = SQLFORM.smartgrid(db.parent, linked_tables=['child'])
``:code
It allows one to access both a ``db.parent`` and a ``db.child``. Apart for navigation controls, for each one table, a smartgrid is nothing but a grid. This means that, in this case, one smartgrid can create a grid for parent and one grid for child. We may want to pass different sets of parameters to these grids. For example different sets of ``searchable`` parameters.

While for a grid we would pass a boolean:
``
grid = SQLFORM.grid(db.parent, searchable=True)
``:code

For a smartgrid we would pass a dictionary of booleans:
``
grid = SQLFORM.smartgrid(db.parent, linked_tables=['child'],
     searchable= dict(parent=True, child=False))
``:code

In this way we made parents searchable but children for each parent not searchable (there should not be that many to need the search widget).

#### grid and smartgrid access control
``grid`` and ``smartgrid`` do not automatically enforce access control like crud does but you can integrate it with ``auth`` using explicit permission checking:

``
grid = SQLFORM.grid(db.auth_user,
     editable = auth.has_membership('managers'),
     deletable = auth.has_membership('managers'))
``:code

or

``
grid = SQLFORM.grid(db.auth_user,
     editable = auth.has_permission('edit', 'auth_user'),
     deletable = auth.has_permission('delete', 'auth_user'))
``:code

#### smartgrid plurals
The ``smartgrid`` is the only object in web2py that displays the table name and it needs both the singular and the plural. For example one parent can have one "Child" or many "Children". Therefore a table object needs to know its own singular and plural names. web2py normally guesses them but you can set them explicitly:

``
db.define_table('child', ..., singular="Child", plural="Children")
``:code

or with: ``singular``:inxx ``plural``:inxx

``
db.define_table('child', ...)
db.child._singular = "Child"
db.child._plural = "Children"
``:code

They should also be internationalized using the ``T`` operator.

The plural and singular values are then used by ``smartgrid``
to provide correct names for headers and links.
